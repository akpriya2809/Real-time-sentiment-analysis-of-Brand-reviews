"Tiger Direct has been around for many years and I have purchased items from it but ten or more years ago.  On Oct 18/14 I ordered a wireless print server and paid $14.25 for shipping and handling.  Payment made through PayPalm on the same day.  The following Monday (20th) I received an e-mail stating that my item had been shipped and providing a UPS tracking number.  The following day I checked the progress of the shipment and was told that it had been delivered.  Used the chat feature and was told that the item was trans shipped and that it would be on its way to me shortly.  Foolishly expecting a further e-mail up-to-date shipping information, I waited until the 27th and then called the chat line again.  I was particularly curious that my order did not show up when I checked my account and all I got was a message saying ""no orders found"". The chat ultimately provided a new shipping reference and I was able to determine that the item had made its way to Concord, ON after stops in several places Concord, ON, Canada  10/29/2014  5:42  Departure Scan Concord, ON, Canada  10/28/2014  0:32  Arrival Scan Windsor, ON, Canada  10/27/2014  20:12  Departure Scan 10/27/2014  18:57  Import Scan 10/27/2014  13:59  Arrival Scan Detroit, MI, United States  10/27/2014  12:21  Arrival Scan Livonia, MI, United States  10/27/2014  11:58  Departure Scan Livonia, MI, United States  10/25/2014  9:56  Arrival Scan Chicago, IL, United States  10/25/2014  3:51  Departure Scan 10/25/2014  1:33  Arrival Scan Addison, IL, United States  10/25/2014  0:54  Departure Scan Addison, IL, United States  10/24/2014  23:17  Export Scan 10/24/2014  23:17  Origin Scan United States  10/24/2014  9:54  Order Processed: Ready for UPS It was now over one week and the item had only just started its shipment to me  I got an e-mail this morning saying ""Thank you for your recent order. Our records indicate your order was completely shipped approximately 10 days ago. At this point, you should have received every item of your order."" I ordered some items on the same day as I placed my TD order about the same weight;  shipping cost less than half of what TD charged and the package was received in nine days. While the shipping processes in this instance were rediculous, the fact that the company never provided any follow up e-mails was abominal. If Tiger Direct expects to compete with online retailers who know what they are doing then it had better pull up its socks and pay attention to its customers.",0,TigerDirect,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/46d4994a000064000500c700/0x0.png,http://www.tigerdirect.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"It was my very first trip with AffordableWorld and it will be my last trip using this travel agency. Over $ 4200 per person this is NOT we expected. Why? Japan: & Hong Kong 1. No welcoming agent upon arrival at the hotel. 2. No meeting scheduled with guide to introduce the traveling companions and describe the itinerary 3. No luggage service whatsoever. == Customers had to carry their own luggage from airport to hotels and from hotels to bus. This is a mandatory service in particular for senior citizens 4. No wake up calls 5. In Japan, guide does not speak English well. Unable to understand most of his explanation 6. In Japan, not enough tours for all that money and too many free days for you to pay more for optional tours 7. Hotel accommodation in Hong Kong was the worst. We extended our stay with an additional 3 nights in the worse hotel in Hong Kong 8. In Hong Kong, we never met any representative from AffordableWorld. The next day, they scheduled a half day tour for us with a free lance guide, who I must say was excellent, but nobody from AffordableWorld. We believe that AW could have sent us a representative to welcome us and talk to us about what to expect and do in Honh Kong. We have been traveling overseas for the last 10 years with one or two  international trips per year. This trip has been the most expensive ones and the most terrible experience.We should get our money back.",0,Affordable World,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5977d0480000ff0005a76d4f/0x0.png,http://affordableworld.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

This was my second order i have placed with them. The first order was delivered about 5 minutes before my wife’s business closed and I placed my order 3 days before it was to be delivered. The second time it was never delivered before my wife’s business was closed and she never received the package. Tried to cancel and get my refund and they give me the run around for 3 days.

"Since I'm away at college, I ordered flowers for my mom the day before Mother's day. Since I waited till the last minute, I was so excited that this site promised they'd be delivered ON Mother's Day. When they were delivered no one was home, so of course I don't blame the site for that. I called their customer service line and was promised they'd be re-delivered the next day. Since the surprise was already ruined, I just asked my mom to make sure she was home all day so she could receive them. They never came. I called again, they apologized, said they'd re-deliver with an apology note and give me a 15% refund. I got the partial refund, but again my poor mom waited all day for them and they never came. I couldn't ask my mom to sit around again all day so I called again and told them I didn't want them re-delivered, I just wanted a full refund. It took a while but the customer service woman finally said she would arrange a full refund.

"I was just starting out with Smile Direct looking to save some money over other products and things did not go well.  I made impressions at home as I live well away from any of the scanning locations.  I returned the impressions as instructed the day after I received them.  Instead of hearing back that they had received my impressions, I received near a dozen emails asking me to return the impressions.  Of course, I already had and had done so via their shipper with their pre-printed label.  I contacted Smile Direct thrice asking if they had, or had not, received the impressions and all I received was the run around.  On one occasion I was told they did not have them.  On another occasion I was told they received them but could not find them.  I was also told a new impression kit would be sent but that has not happened.

"We booked a flight with Bravofly, and all seemed ok until we realised that there was no luggage included in the flight. So we decided to call them to book and pay for baggage. Sounds easy... It wasn't. We called. And called. And called. When we managed to get through to any of the seemingly massive team of ""customer service"" advisors, each picked for their rudeness, terrible grasp of the English language and a seeming desire to ruin your trip, we eventually managed to force a promise from them to get someone to call us to arrange the baggage booking. Ok, so we should now get a call. Right? Not right. We did get a few tries at random times, (not English time friendly at all,) but when we couldn't answer (we are both very busy) they didn't bother trying again or leaving a message until we called and asked them to get someone to call again. We did try calling back but the number didnt work! And this happened again and again. Only once did they leave a message, which was completely rude and unintelligible. This despite the fact that we asked on a few occasions that they call us both on different numbers which they never did. Eventually we told them that if they don't sort it out then we would leave a bad review online. Miracle of miracles - they called the next morning (albeit before 8:00!) and sorted everything in less than 5 minutes! All I can say is avoid BravoFly like the plague - they have honestly given the very worst customer service (or lack thereof) that I have ever experienced.

I reviewed a number of seats for location, view, and cost before deciding on the ones I purchased.  After receiving my tickets it was noted that there was a partial view obstruction.  The obstruction was not shown on the view of my seats on the website nor would I consider any ticket to a sporting/theater event with a partial obstruction to be a best value seat.  StubHub's customer service representative was indifferent to my issue, they would not take the tickets back, and put the onus on me to resell the tickets so that I could then have the money to repurchase seats without an obstructed view.",0,StubHub,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/46d356a1000064000500ae6d/0x0.png,http://www.stubhub.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Unexpectedly cancelled my orders, TWICE. I had set up automatic delivery service for my mother to receive bouquets every month. First my valentine's day order was not received with no info from the company that it was cancelled. It was only have my mother called me to say she thought she was receiving flowers and didn't that I tried to contact the company and resolve. They had a technical error that cancelled my order. The company sent some cheap lilies instead of what I had ordered and my mother didn't care for them much. At least I wasn't charged since they entirely missed the holiday. Then for Easter I had another order to be sent and the exact same issue occurred. This time they only gave me a $15 credit and we completely missed any flowers to be sent for the occasion and it would take a month to get the order I had originally paid for sent. It's a great concept and when it works the flowers are nice. But if the orders keep getting mysteriously cancelled and never arrive I don't care how nice the flowers are, nothing arriving is the worst possible outcome for floral delivery company.

In May of 2019 I purchased my work phone as I got a new position. They purchased the phone in full from AT&T. I opened an account and was told that I could unlock my phone and switch if I wanted. When I tried to unlock my phone online the nightmare began. While contacting AT&T I was given many different reason why my phone wouldn’t unlock including “you technically don’t own the phone” which was shocking. A few more calls and a support specialist told me that the account was not 90 days old so you can’t unlock until then. 90 days go by still can’t unlock my phone. Again I get multiple reason why including again that you don’t own the phone. That is funny cause I have been using your poor service with this phone for months. At this point I decided to port my number to a new phone if they didn’t unlock it. Then they just magically unlocked it. Like they could of done from the beginning. I will never use AT&T again. They lied to me and called me a liar. I hope their company goes bankrupt.,0,AT&T,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46a161e50000640005004ff8/198x149.png,http://www.att.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"This review is soley for the company NOT the product. I purchased contacts (Biofinity Toric which are somewhat more expensive) on Dec 18th which were advertised for $29.95 per box and that seems like a great compared to $45 in other places. Once I went to checkout, their hidden fee all of a sudden appeared and it brought the average per box an extra $8.50 (I purchased 2 boxes and it was about $17) in “other fees” plus an extra $5.95 for shipping.  That’s ridiculous in my opinion and bad business practice. The delivery wasn’t bad but for the size and weight of the package, I’ve sent packages out for less than their $.5.95 (I assume that’s including a delivery fee as well).

"Verify my activity before redeeming? What the hell does that even mean? Clearly the sites that pay us, have verified I have taken their surveys and have either paid me, or ok'ed it with your system to pay me. That's about all the verification I should need. So this is a new review. It's been a while. Haven't been having too many issues except tonight again. I do them as often as possible. Try and cash out weekly. Except this time I have $31.79 and it's not telling me to contact customer service to cash out? Excuse me but it states right in your Help menu, under Redemption, Option 1 There is no maximum limit. Yet, clearly there is. As for other reviews on here. ""Rushing"" through a survey is too simple for the fact that demographic questions over and over become habit and are easy answers. Also, when a company is asking me about subscription services and I mention in the beginning I don't have any, but then they ask me over and over and list every single subscription service they can find, It's not ""rushing"" to go to the bottom of the page and just hit ""None"" and ""Next"". That's the surveys fault for asking us questions they've asked us in the beginning. Not our faults. We don't make them, we just answer them. And we have to answer them the way they are presented to us. Some are more fast paced, some are super slow. Most are fast paced. You've also noticed the time suggestion is no longer on the survey cards. So they can't really hold a time limit to us since there isn't one. Most surveys also are digging for the answers they want. Not what we have to say. ie, JD Power and Chevy trying to claim they've been surveyed the best. That's not true. If I tell a survey I don't like that brand. I'm disqualified. Proving, they're only wanting answers that give them the best rep. Not what the REAL public has to say I'd also like to point out to my Oregon readers and users. In this great state. If you earn it. IT'S YOURS. They aren't allowed to withhold, or keep your earnings. What you earn in Oregon is yours too keep, They can make limits, but they can't take it or not pay you.

"Airbnb is crap shoot when it comes to places to stay while traveling. Unfortunately I did not know this until after using the service just once! In my case, my wife accidentally left her laptop at the place we were staying in LA (#SUPER LOCATION!!! 2BED W/ GREAT AMENITIES!). This should have been pretty simple to recover. I contacted the host first thing the very next day via phone so I was talking to him. They claim to have searched high and low and did not find the laptop. It was sitting right there!!! So either the cleaning people took it, the host took it, or someone else that had a key to the place took it. Note that anyone can have a key to the place so lock up your valuables or better yet use a reputable hotel where the keys are generated new for each customer. I read a couple more reviews about the place we stayed at and several other renters reported things disappearing and luggage being searched. In addition to this, the place was not as close to the attractions as listed, the amenities like pool and hot tub were either not working or poorly maintained, the dinning room light was out, it was right next to LAX so you heard planes all day and night, and there was not enough room for people to sit at. Crazy! Bad experience and I do not recommend Airbnb.

"I booked an airline ticket (Itenary No - 7413663141674) from Expedia. They booked it through ETIHAD Airways departing March 1st, 2019 from Toronto to Mumbai and Returning from Mumbai to Toronto on March 12, 2019. For some reason, I had to cancel the flight.

I have been chasing them to get my $1100 refund back. I called them multiple times to check the status of my refund on my credit card. Every call is 1 hour wait time. It has been 3 months I have not received my refund yet. They are repeating the same story to check with ETIHAD's accounting department (Case ID - 23787019) and ETIHAD said to check with Expedia. I talked to one of the customer representatives today she said she will call ETIHAD behalf of me and will find out the status and kept me on hold and said if the call will drop she will call me back.

"I called JustFly to ask a couple questions while filling out the forms to purchase a ticket, and suddenly found myself being practically forced into buying it over the phone. Since the sales person claimed that I could get a lower price when choosing seats if I order over the phone, it would be best to stay on the call. Although I'm aware of sales tactics, I decided I might as well have them do it anyway, since it takes any liability off me. Well, after all that, and they booked my ticket, I found out they had only put my son's middle initial instead of his actual middle name... And when I called them about it, they apologized and eventually came to the conclusion that we had to cancel the ticket. So, although they did give me a refund, it takes up to 1 to 2 weeks for charges to come back into an account... which means that now I need to wait a while to buy another ticket - as prices rise...

"Not a trustworthy company. I rented a book for a Spring 2014 class, ""Modern Management: Concepts and Skills"" by Samuel Certo and Trevis Certo, ISBN: 9780132176316. After sending it back in what I thought was an acceptable condition, packaging it in the same box I received it in (along with another rental book), I received an email from a Knetbooks customer service representative telling me that the book was damaged beyond usability and that the company would charge me a replacement fee. I checked my bank account and discovered that the fee had been charged the day BEFORE I was informed. I was charged $262.82, which I assume is the price of a brand new copy (I wasn't told why that was the amount). The so-called damaged copy is a 2011 edition that has been obviously rented out before, as evidenced by scribbled notes, highlights, and the normal wear and tear I saw when first receiving it. I could buy this 2011 edition today, brand new, for $25. I have contacted their customer service twice already to protest their predatory behavior. I have also asked them to send me a photo of the damaged book as proof, but I was told they do not have the ""capability"" to do so. Their responses amount to the usual corporate avoidance tactics: a sentence or two apologizing for the inconvenience and the rest a ""copy and paste"" of company policy claiming that they can charge me any fee, up to the cost of the book, at their discretion. In summary, I have been given no chance to protest this unethical action. I 'm contacting my bank and will be writing Knetbooks' owner(s), my college, and if needed, the County Prosecutor and other internet forms to reclaim my money. I have already contacted some college professors, who have agreed to circulate the information to their students. Do business with them at your peril. RESPONSE TO AMANDA: Hello Amanda. Thank you for your response. There is no active dispute with the bank at the moment. I've posted this as a comment and also emailed Knetbooks to make sure you get it. I am not familiar with Trustpilot's notification system. 1) As I requested in an email to Knetbooks customer service, I want to see a picture of the item, the damage, and an explanation of why I was charged that amount. Looking at other reviews on Knetbooks, your company seems to circulate damaged books, and as such, you are very vague on what is ""unusable."" 2) Thank you for opening up with an offer, but what you propose is not enough. What you are suggesting is that I pay you and also get you a new book. It is not my responsibility as the customer to replace your books; that is on you. Example: If I total a car, the insurance company will pay me a check at the current value of the car so that I replace it. At no point is the insurance company expected to replace my car. 3) I will continue pushing for a full refund. If you send me proof of damage incurred by ME, I will negotiate, and only if I get a signed letter from your company saying you will honor the agreement. A number of negative reviews have popped up in the last three days, some similar to mine, and my trust level towards your company is even lower than it was prior to your response.

"As a small business we have a lot of experience with DHL. We do not send stuff out to customers using DHL, but sometimes our suppliers use DHL to send products to us or our directly to our customers. We find 80% of these shipments just disappear and are never delivered. When you look into it via tracking or emailing them or whatever, you get the 'the driver couldn't access the delivery address' routine. We are a business and are here all the time and day in day out we get perfect service for other carriers like Hermes, UPS, and many many others. But DHL fail to deliver, they never leave a card if you are out and always try to pin the blame on the delivery address being in accessible. Obviously we do not send shipments with DHL but we will now also insist that products we order from suppliers are delivered by any carrier except DHL.

So the moron on the other side of the phone even insulted me within the first sentence of our conversation. I'm so glad my money didn't go to this place. As a manager this place is poorly ran and the people who run it need some training and probably should try to develope better people skills.

I bought 2 sports bras - 1 black and 1 white. I wore the white one once and when I took it off noticed there were 10 runs (like you would get in pantyhose) I never washed the item.  I emailed Her Room today to ask for a exchange and how to go about it and was quickly told that they to not take anything back that has been washed or worn. I replied back that I had not washed it however due to the fact that I had worn it they have a no return policy. Apparently they have a no return policy on everything. I was most disappointed that they wouldn't exchange an obviously flawed item.I am not large chested which is why I like to wear sports bras. The fact that it had runs in it was caused due to a flaw in manufacturing not on my part.

The reason craigslist is better it's free. Even though on RVT I have over 150-160 people look at my Camper I did not have anybody actually call or email me about my camper until I hit the 150-160 mark.  Had less pictures  on craigslist but the description and price was the same. I don't know if it's difficult trying to get a hold of somebody through RVT. All I know is I am out $70-$80. If i had to do it all over again I would not use RVT and just went with  Craigslist.,0,RVT.com Classifieds,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/54d00de90000ff00057d28a8/198x149.png,http://www.RVT.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"I just returned home after being stranded in Ireland by Globus during the snow storm.  When things are going well, Globus is a great company. But during adverse events such as the snow storm Globus dropped the ball on customer service.  I realize this weather was beyond their control but please just communicate with it’s passengers.  I had ZERO  direc contact from Globus even tho they had our contact information. All we needed was reassurance from them that everything would be okay.  That’s why we booked directly through them, so we would not have to worry about transport and hotel issues.  40% of the tour was cancelled.  We were told  we had to rebook the cancelled flights ourselves and find our own way to the airport.  And when they finally ended up rescheduling the cancelled  flight 3 days later, all the hotel arrangements were on us.  When Saturday rolled around,  the original end date of the tour, they dropped you off either at the airport (where most flights had been cancelled anyway) or to the  last hotel originally scheduled.  They then said “see ya”. I felt totally stranded in a foreign country which is why I thought I would have avoided these problems by booking with a tour company.  ABANDONED, TIRED, and DISAPPOINTED with the customer care I received by Globus.  A direct apology would have been nice or a partial refund, or a voucher towards another trip.",0,Globus,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/564f8e5b0000ff000585c4ef/198x149.png,http://globusjourneys.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"I bought a part from Parts Geek and the purchase was flawless, however, UPS lost my package.  I could not get help from UPS for over two weeks as to a resolution and, after that period, was told to contact the shipper (Parts Geek).  The only way to contact your company is through an automated email system.  This contact via email took another 4 days to reach a resolution.  I have since been told that my refund would be credited but will require another 5 to 8 days.  What this amounts to is an approximate time span of a month to be reimbursed for something I DID NOT receive.  I was repairing this vehicle for a customer and had to purchase this part from another dealer for almost three times the price. Your company not having a means of providing feedback by telephone is VERY inconvenient.  This issue could have been resolved within a week, not a month.  The inconvenience of having to purchase the part again from another company and not having been reimbursed prior to that second purchase is aggravating.  I will not purchase from Parts Geek again, even though your prices for OEM parts are outstanding, I can't work with the inability to speak with a customer service representative when potential issues arise.",0,Parts Geek,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/48e8f359000064000503beb4/198x149.png,http://www.partsgeek.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I was told “gentle hand washing techniques” would have to be used. The logos also came off during hand washing. Emailed customer support twice and included photos of the logos washing off. Both times they replied I had to wash more glasses and send more photos. This is rediculous! If it washes off on the first three glasses we take out of the shipping box, why do I have to keep washing others to see if it comes off those too!?

On 8/13/2016 I ordered a group of 7 different silver eagles and I had to return the 2003 because it had a lg. pock mark in the obv. Customer service was ok for all the returns I have had lately. Now more than 2 MONTHS LATER 10/18/2016 I get the replacement coin and its WORSE than the original as the obv. is all banged up with contact marks. I don't understand what is going on with Penn Metals lately. One return after another. I had returned an expensive certified Denali ATB and received a worse one in exchange. I will never recover my losses as who wants junk. I doubt that they will allow this to be shown. If I am wrong I apologize.,0,Penn Metals Group,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/563580a20000ff000584ff01/198x149.png,http://www.pennmetals.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
They have very bad customer service starting with the vendors up to the manager at Castleton store.

"I will never use Vayama, or Kayak again.  I went through Kayak which rerouted me to Vayama to book a ticket from Lima to Cuzco and back.  The fare seemed great, and even though it was non-refundable I went ahead and pulled the trigger, meanwhile passing up on another good fare that was 20 dollars more.  Fast forward 2 days and I got the following email: ""Dear Sir / Madam, We recently received your online booking request. Unfortunately, the airline was unable to accept the fare that was offered earlier, therefore, your booking could not be processed. Per our terms and conditions on your Booking Confirmation, air fares and reservations are not guaranteed until tickets are issued. New total fare $ 389.00. If you accept or reject please respond to the email. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We trust to have you informed sufficiently and that our answer meets you expectations. In case of any additional questions feel free to contact us again. Kind regards, Vayama.com"" So I guess the advertised price wasn't the actual price they were offering??  I was outraged, but at this point the prices had increased substantially across the board.  So I emailed back and told them fine, but that I wasn't happy about it.  Fast forward yet another day and I received the following email: Dear Sir / Madam, We thank you very much for your e-mail. We recently received your online booking request. Quality control has determined that your booking could not be processed at the fare  that was originally quoted. New total fare $ 464.02usd . If you accept or reject please respond to the email. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We trust to have you informed sufficiently and that our answer meets you expectations. In case of any additional questions feel free to contact us again. Kind regards, Vayama.com Sadiya Razvi. I am astonished that a company that advertises one price, then pulls that offer after booking, and then DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN is able to turn a profit.  I am also disgusted at the incredible poor customer service.  If I had just booked with the other carrier I would have had a confirmed ticket for just 20 dollars more than the original price.  Beware that the fares that they advertise are just apparitions.

"We offered to book our elderly family members on the same flight to Canada although 1 member, for health reasons, had saved up to fly Business Class at considerable cost. My husband was unable to book them all online so contacted Expedia directly. The telephone operator booked the Business Class passenger on a different return flight to the others by mistake. When we realised this on the paperwork, Expedia wanted £350 to put it right, even though it was their representative who made the mistake. I have now spent 5 hours making many phone calls and put in a formal complaint to Expedia. They agreed to just charge the Delta airline cost of £200 which the elderly relative reluctantly agreed to pay whilst the complaint was investigated. By this point she was concerned about ensuring she was booked on the correct flight. The mistake was discovered with 2 months still to go before the flight and the representative I spoke to could not answer my question: “how long should we have had to check that the original details were correct?” Initially their answer was maybe 24 hours which I said was ridiculous considering the elderly relative was not online and I needed to post her the flight details to check! Expedia told me it would take 4 weeks to process my complaint and we are now up to 8 weeks with no response. They also charged my credit card with the £200 fee twice along with the discount of £150 which they should have taken off, not added to the bill. This has since been refunded.  Over the hours that I have been kept waiting on the phone, all I could hear was a claxon going off and cheering which suggests to me that all this company is interested in is reaching sales targets. Incredibly unprofessional company and too willing to exploit those they perceive to have so much money that they don’t question these exorbitant charges. We found this particularly disappointing when it is Expedia themselves who made the error. We would never consider using them again for any future journeys.",0,Expedia,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46d9f1b100006400050106cf/198x149.png,http://www.expedia.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"NEVER use Expedia for any of your travel needs! They screwed up our accommodations for our trip to Bay City for the Fourth of July. My husband is a disabled veteran. We made one reservation with Double Tree and cancelled the request as we needed a bigger room. We then made another reservation with the same hotel but ended up canceling the reservation as we found a better hotel that was able to accommodate our needs for a better price. We were surprised when we were charged two no show fees at the first hotel. We contacted the hotel directly and in their system Expedia made 4 reservations and only two were cancelled. Which was not the case. We then contacted Expedia the customer service representative was not helpful at all. He transferred our call back to the hotel. Then we were transferred again, but this time to the manager of the hotel. The manager understood the situation and is refunding our money. Today we were charged again for the no showed visits. We now have four charges to our account. We’ve talked to the hotel again this morning and will have to wait until the manager is in to see why we were charged again. We’ve talked with our bank and they assured us we will be receiving this money back. But Expedia was not helpful at all. Avoid Expedia for your travel needs! We were not able to enjoy our vacation during this time due to our funds being tampered with. We have two young children who were looking forward to this trip as well. Try explaining the situation to two heartbroken kids. They dropped the ball entirely and blamed the hotel instead holding any accountability for their mistakes. Thanks Expedia for ruining our time off with our family. Very hard to make memories if you don’t have money for your travel plans. Over $600 taken from our account. I will tell EVERY person I know to avoid your company at all costs.",0,Expedia,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46d9f1b100006400050106cf/198x149.png,http://www.expedia.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Facebook had the good intention of connecting friends and family seamlessly no matter how far away, however it has become a platform for abuse and extremists. You can't join a single group without having to hear someone's personal views and beliefs shoved down your throat, should you disagree with or have a different view you will receive abusive personal messages and comments left on the page. Obvious facts and scientific evidence is disregarded in favour or personal belief, and people create groups just to start a cult. I've had people claim, science means nothing, and it don't matter if someone is committing fraud as long as it makes people feel better. Avoiding the groups on things you love, interests, hobbies, bands, stars, etc is the way to go. The only thing Facebook is good for is finding friends of family you have lost contact with, (or people you are stalking) but even then you will need to know there full married names and or locations. Being that you have lost contact with these people you probaly won't have this information, making it only good for stalking people you know details of. Which leads me to, if you have an abusive ex, ex friend, or just a stalker who wishes to know your personal life and or give you grief best you struggle with the hundreds of different settings to make your profile invisible to anyone not already on your friends list, again making anyone with good intent trying to find you impossible. Furthermore,  they changed the messaging service so you now have to install another app and risk all your personal information on another platform. No one ever gets banned or punished for there rude, extreme or aggressive abusive messages. You can block people so they cannot abuse you further but this does not stop there extremist views being pushed on and threats being made to others. They also try to force you to upload I.D of yourself personally so they can verify your name, this seems hugely inappropriate and they should just accept they created a platform for trolls and abuse and should shut down there website if they cannot control the problem not police the users like a corrupt government. The only real actual use of Facebook is communicating between friends and family, which you could use a phone for and as such bypass all of the other problems with this service.",0,Facebook,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/521fb8d50000640005768f4d/198x149.png,https://www.facebook.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"BEWARE OF FEDEX! If you want your packages delivered on time, or just plain delivered, use USPS or UPS. USPS is my favorite. FedEx delivery problems I have had over the past 40 (!!!!) years: 1. They cannot find my house. There are only 8 houses on my street and my mailbox at the foot of the driveway has the house number on both sides in 5 inch reflective characters. 2. My gate was locked. I do not have a gate, 3. My driveway was inaccessible. My driveway is 150 feet long up a hill. It is paved with a turnaround at the top. UPS and USPS have no trouble driving up to deliver packages. 4. They left the package at my gate. I repeat myself, but I don't have a gate, or a fence either. 5. My dog made them nervous. I do not have a dog. 6. They left large heavy packages at the foot of my driveway. I am a 78 year old, disabled, widow. It is their job to deliver my packages to my front door - not mine! 7. They have placed packages in my mailbox which is illegal unless it is a ""Smart Post"" delivery - which these were not. 8. They have lost packages. OK, the supplier files a claim and sends me a new item - BUT NOT WHEN I WANTED IT. 9. They left a package clearly marked ""Fragile,"" ""Perishible"" floating around Memphis for an extra day. i don't know about you, but I get nervous about eating frozen seafood that has defrosted in Memphis. 10. Three packages to be delivered on the same day, all requiring my signature, were placed on three different trucks. Two arrived, the third did not. Apparently FedEx does not have the ability to sort packages by zip code, and place them on the same trucks. 11. They were unable to contact the driver to check about a delivery. Yes, this WAS in 2017. Cell phones anyone? They need to set up some sort of communication process. 13. FedEx outsources much of their delivery in San Antonio. This is about as successful as government outsourcing. I could go on, but I am tired. The package that was suppose to arrive yesterday by 5:40 PM came at 11:18 PM. Unfortunately, at the suggestion of a FedEx supervisor, I gave up and went to sleep at 10:30. Since the package required a signature, it was not left at my door. Maybe tomorrow . . . Since I have filed multiple complaints about all of these problems with FedEx management, one would think that any package with my name and address would trigger flashing red lights and alarms, Well, maybe they do. . . A warning to FedEx. With the advent of more on-line shopping, people will be depending on shipping companies that care about customer service. FedEx used to be the gold standard, but no more. You are not too big to fail, ask JC Penny, Sears, etc.",0,FedEx,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46f40d880000640005019648/198x149.png,http://www.fedex.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"This is my first time booking from snap travel, and I won’t  do it again! Worst travel agency ever nothing but liars starting with Marks he’ll makes promises and does not even return called. We had book two rooms back in January. On march 15 found out that my daughter and her family could not makesit due to her infant daugther not having a Pasport I immediately notified them explain the situation. On March 16 I called again to follw up that’s when agent Marks told me that not to worry that since I notified them with plenty of time that a full refund be provided and a text or email will follow I decided to drive to the hotel where the reservation was made, but not cancellation have comes to the hotel yet. I called Snap travel again and have Marks speak with the receptionist at the hotel because Marks have told me that they have already pay the hotel which was a lie, because the hotel told me and him they do not get pay until after the client checks out but again he reassure to not to worry he will makes sure a full refund will be given. By 5 PM on the 16 I still have not received any email and calls the agency again and happen to speak with Mark and that when he mention that it might be a penalty, i mention to Him why he has not mention it until now because I would have found somebody to occupy that other room, I mention a change of date so I won’t loose my money, He told me that I was a priority that they were working my case dilligently and he took my cell number and told me he will call me himself. The 18 Monday was the date of our check in, I waited all day for a text an email or a phone call, came to the hotel to check in and the receptionist told us that we still have two rooms assigns and if we does not found somebody for the rooms that it will go as a no show and we will loose the money. We struggle to find a friend to use the room today is the 19 and Snap Travel still has not contact us plase, please stay AWAY from this site I would not WiSH this on anybody. We contacted you on the 15 because of the circunstances with my daughter I contacted the hotel myself and they told me you guys never contacted them to try to cancelled the reservation. When we show up to the hotel they told since they have not cancel the reservation ( meaning you ) it will go as a no show and not refund money will be given. They suggested my best bet will be to call someone to use the room.

"The flight was delayed and then passengers were rushed into the airplane. My boarding pass was checked and approved and I was about to go to the airplane when another member of WizzAir staff requested that I showed my boarding pass yet again which I did. He then requested that I measured my cabin luggage. The luggage was small and it did fit into the measuring rack. There was, in fact, plenty of space around it. The only thing that was ‘sticking out’ were the wheels. The member of your staff then informed me that I would have to pay £40 for the luggage. I pointed out that the luggage size was perfect and that it was only the wheels. He insisted that the bag would not be classified as ‘small’ and the alternative to paying for it would be to leave it behind. I said that I travelled a few days before (also with WizzAir) and I had exactly the same luggage and there has never been any problem with it. The member of WizzAir staff then said “this is how cheap airlines make money – the flight is cheap and we are strict with the luggage”. I found it to be very unprofessional, rude and offensive. I have never been treated in such a disrespectful manner by any other airline. The fact that I was overcharged for the “wheels” of my luggage is shocking . The statement made by the WizzAir staff member will definitely make me think twice before I book a flight with WizzAir.

"I have had repeated bad experiences with FedEx trying to purchase the same item from Walmart 3 times in the past month.  The first time, I received a notification of an exception by FedEx.  I called and was told the package was found to be damaged in Ocala, FL (I  live in the Tampa, FL area) and they told me to call Walmart.  Walmart immediately placed a replacement order for me.  The second one made it to Parrish, FL and I checked when I saw it going back to the Panhandle area of FL and was told by FedEx that package was damaged in route and was being returned to the sender.  I then called Walmart and they suggested that I would have to place a new order which I did.  It was supposed to arrive on the 26th.  I tracked it to be sitting in TN from early on the 25th and no contact by them.  When I called the first time they said it was delayed as they were snowed in.  I called back on the 27, seeing that it had not moved and was told they would put a trace on it and I would hear back within 48 hours.  72 hours later, no word from them and as it is now a Sunday, when I tried to call they are closed.  Surprise, Surprise.  This is simply an unacceptable way to do business in my  opinion and I am accordingly going to make another purchase now through Walmart.  My guess is that FedEx keeps having to pay for the damaged shipments and I am sure I am not the only one.  Perhaps with all these losses we will get lucky and they will be forced out of business (not likely) and Walmart will wake up and start using a more qualified shipper.

"For transferring money, perhaps paypal is okay. However, for any sort of online purchases, the seller can scam you, and get paypal to side with them 100% of the time. Here is how it works (or rather not work in PayPal's case). The seller send a fake package (like an empty envelope) with tracking number to somewhere in buyer's city. The fake package will not have buyer's address so it will never be delivered. The tracking will show as delivered, and at this point if the buyer opens a ""item not received"" dispute with PayPal, PayPal will automatically side with the seller. PayPal official policy is this: as long as the seller provides a tracking number that shows something has been delivered to the buyer's city, PayPal will rule in favor of the seller pretty much 100% of the time. evidance from Canada Post will be ignored.

"I needed a place to stay for four months while in New York. I considered getting a sublet, or signing a lease, but it just seemed inconvenient when i couldn't view apartments in person and the time frame was not amenable to a lease. So, I started sending out messages to AirBnB hosts. I was very clear that I would be staying for four months and was a student doing an internship. I was also very clear that I wanted a place that would allow my fiancé to visit once a month. I finally found what i thought was a winner. $850/month for a room in a safe neighborhood that looked clean. When I got there, the owner did not speak english, which i was okay with, but she seemed surprised when I said I was staying for 4 months. Turns out she isn't the owner, but the mother of the owner who lives in the apartment, and just passes on messages from her daughter. Things were okay at first, the living room was not usable as it was filled with boxes and suitcases filled with god-knows-what. The woman, who was the mother, began staying up in the living room at all hours, listening to LOUD spanish tv on her computer. She would sit there and watch me cook, it was extremely uncomfortable. On top of all this, when my fiancé came to visit, she tells me I owe her $25 every night he visits. This was not what I had agreed on via messages through AirBnB. I start getting messages from the daughter that I owe her $89 and have repeatedly broken the house rules that there be no visitors. I'm shocked considering the message I have from her that says my fiancé would be okay to stay for two days once a month for free! I repeatedly reference the message and tell her I won't pay. After that neither of them say anything to me, but the mother comes into the apartment with another woman and two small children who are SCREAMING! The children spend the night over the weekend, and are running all over the apartment early in the morning. I had no notice this would happen, as the add on AirBnB says children are not allowed in the apartment. AirBnB was no help at all during this process, and they basically stated they have no control over the renters or additional fees. I work at a law firm as an intern, and have to sleep during the week. I'm not loud and I clean up after myself. But I HATED staying here!

They were supposed to call my vet to get the prescription approved and waited two days! Then I got an email that said my order had been processed and I would recieve my product in 4 days (approx.). I never got it. It gets worse.... so I called them back. By now my cat is out of surgery and has been home for two days with regular food. I asked them what I am supposed to do about food and their response was to just keep feeding him his regular food (that causes urethra crystals, and why he had surgery). So i asked where is the food I paid for... they said oh... didnt you get an email? Your vet declined it. I guess we didnt send youan email because he didnt give us a reason code?

"This is beyond unacceptable. I placed an order for contacts 4 days ago. It is still in the prescription verification page. I tried contacting them through their website and got a message saying they will get back to me within 24 hours. That time came and went without any information on their part. So I called them and talked to a customer service representative named Robin. Robin told me they would try again to verify my prescription and that the place that has my script hasn't gotten back to them. So that means they tried verifying my script and my order was just going to sit there until the place got back to them. I mentioned that the shipping stated I'd get my order in 5-7 buisness day. He said that happens after the order gets processed, and technically my order wasn't processed. Their website says ""Contact Lenses Orders placed before 2:00pm EST will be processed that same business day. Instock contact lens orders ship out within 1 - 2 business days. "" They are not being truthful on their website. It has been FOUR days. However, that is a fight I do not wish to partake in. Yet They had no trouble collecting my money for my order. That was processed instantly. I know that it is illegal to sell contacts in America without a script. But the law states that if the place does not get back to you within eight hours you can ship the contacts. I explained to the customer service representative Robin that I am on my last pair of contacts and that I need my order. The order should have been shipped at the latest yesterday. Then I asked the customer service representative what happens if the store doesn't get back to them, to which he replied that there were going to be options to consider. I asked him what the options were, and he said ""he can't talk about them"".

"After we placed our order, Phone Power ran into difficulties porting our existing phone number because our current service is provided though a PBX located in the condo complex in which we live.  As a result, we do not receive an individual phone bill with our name on it.  A bulk bill is sent to our condo management company which redistributes the costs to individual co-owners via our monthly condo fees. At one point, Phone Power felt that we had provided sufficient information to port our existing phone number, so they accepted our order and shipped the VoIP modem to us.  However, after they had shipped the hardware, their telephone service provider refused to execute the order because we could not produce an invoice with the telephone number and our name and address on it.  Therefore, through no fault of our own, we had to cancel the order.  When we received the VoIP modem, I immediately returned it to Phone Power.   Since they shipped it before ensuring that their service provider had accepted the order, I requested that they reimburse me for the $17.57 that it cost me to return the hardware.  They refused.

"I don't want to be a truck driver, but guess how many ""recommendations"" show up in my in-box for OTR/CDL Drivers? So far, every company with whom I've applied has been extremely slow to respond and slow to remove job postings that are no longer open. The few responses I've received for my resume' have been scams or other job sites. As a job-seeker, the market is pretty good, but the very impersonal, tedious methodology for applying is awful.  I've received turn-down notices from jobs nearly 3 months after applying, and the job itself was barely worth applying for in the first place. I feel it's pretty stupid to have to submit a resume' for a delivery job that pays just above minimum wage... I mean really???  And, on top of that, the HR personnel seem to be very apathetic.  Should a company that is reliant on low-skill level, high turnover manpower not have a more efficient screening process? As a job site, CareerBuilder may be the least of the evils, but it's still evil never-the-less.

The main reason is due to the county that the home is located in. Initially, Zach had it that you were looking at homes in a county that has a higher loan limit, which allows us to avoid the larger down payment. In Hartford county however, the loan limit is lower which results in the larger down payment. Due to the county loan limit, there is no way around the 15% down payment.

"If I were only rating customer service I would give a 4 or 5 star. They took care of my order issue immediately. However the majority of this rating is regarding the products. I purchased andro 1, 4, and andro EPI. I also purchased anabolic matrix but haven't used it yet. There was a lot of talk in the descriptions of these products that really made them look great. I'm about half way through them right now and have seen ZERO positive effects. No muscle gain,  no weight gain, no strength gain, nothing. All these do is give you severe heart burn. And I mean severe. I have to take them with an over the counter acid reducer I get from Costco. This review is not final as I still have half the bottle to go. But I would have hoped to see something. If somehow all the changes take place during the end of the cycle then I'll repost. But as of now, I work out for an hour 6 days a week. 5 of those are weight training, 1 is cardio and would think something spoken as highly as these products are on the website I would have had some increase somewhere.

"I had purchased 3 tickets through Vayama.  I was sent to the website from Kayak.  I thought the transaction in general was concerning.  It didn't ask for any information besides our names and only my address.  After I submitted my request I looked up reviews on Vayama in which they were all horror experiences.  I received a confirmation email immediately and a few hours later received my E-tickets.  I looked at my bank statement and saw pending charges for my tickets and a separate one for the insurance.  I checked back 5 days later.  The pending charge for my ticket disappeared but the charge for the insurance went through.  I called Vayama.  I was told that the money was taken out of my account but they were waiting for verification from my bank.  I called my bank (in which I've never had any issues with) they said that the money was pending to come out of my account but Vayama took to long to have the charges go through so the payment was dropped and no future payments were scheduled.  I called Vayama back.  Vayama said that the payment had been delayed and it wouldn't process for at least another 2-3 days.  I continued to read reviews of people having issues.  Out of fear of losing my tickets last minute/not getting my money back/not be able to on a trip with my child I decided to cancel the ticket.  When I called I explained that I had not been charged for my ticket.  The woman continued to tell me that I did even though I explained that I had been in contact with my bank. I actually said ""how can I have paid for these tickets when my bank has no proof of this charge"" she said thats how it works and it will show up in my bank statement in 10-15 days. So I said I wanted to cancel my ticket. They told me it was $400 dollars to cancel my flight even thought I had purchased insurance.  They gave me another number to call in which I haven't done yet.  I don't understand how Im being charged for a $400 to cancel a ticket I never even paid for.   Being a single mom and having saved up for literally YEARS for this tickets overseas to visit family has me beyond frustrated/upset/angry. I've talked to Vayama 3 different times today and every time have been told something different. I don't understand why it the money would be pending out my account.. disappear.. then come back and take 10-15 days to process.  I've had my fair share of flights and I've never bought a ticket that took 10-15 days to process.  As of right now I have the ""tickets"" in which I never paid for.

"If I could leave less than 1 star I would! This has been the WORST car buying experience of my life. When I purchased the first vehicle I was told the day prior that my delivery would be delayed 1 week, then they stated they could get it to me later that week but to keep from taking another day off work they. had me change my delivery to my work address, upon changing the contract my finance terms changed dramatically for the worse. Then the vehicle had what was clearly cigarette burns all over the two front seats of the car and up by the visor, really with this intense inspection they supposedly put their vehicles through?! After finding another vehicle all was set for yet another delivery at 9 am. At 8:20 am of delivery date the driver called to let me know the freight truck broke down and he would drive the vehicle to me and arrive in 20 minutes. At 9 am he again called to tell me the 3 year old Nissan Altima was making terrible noises and he was taking it to a mechanic but he suspected it was transmission issues. I then cancelled that car and I am now on car #3. Once I completed this purchase the terms of my financing changed again and they said to get back to my originally quoted down payment of $500 I had to purchase the Carvana Care Plan and extend my monthly payments by 3 months and increase my payments by $14 dollars. Real shady business! Trying to deal with customer service you wait on hold for minutes, then wait for your call to be return for another extended period of time. Then every customer service rep is clueless and does nothing to help. How they have an A+ BBB rating is beyond me! I wouldn't recommend Carvana to my worst enemy.

The email title said I won $50 in wine, but the gift card they gave me was only for $40. 2. You can't buy anything for $40 from the website. If you're not an 'Angel', someone who has invested in the company to help winemakers, then you have to pay regular price for a bottle. The cheapest bottle they had when I checked the website about 3 weeks ago and again today is $9.99, and in order to checkout you have to buy at least 6 bottles to complete a case. That's ($9.99 x 6) + (S&H $9.99) = $69.93. This means you have to spend an extra $30 to use your free wine card. Sneaky. 3. I didn't win anything if I have to spend money on it.

"Fedex customer service should learn to tell the truth to their customers. I've been tracking my packages, it's landed in Dorval on Monday 7am.

When I asked her ""so due to high volume but it arrives 2 days earlier and you won't deliver for another 2 day because of your ETA, wouldn't it be great if your customer receives their packages ahead of ETA?

"So I run this little website for Ireland's largest angling club. All goes well for some years and I'm really happy with the system despite its quirkiness. Then for no reason I can understand the site starts to gobble up bandwidth - so much so that I repeatedly exceed the bandwidth allocation and Webs repeatedly suspend the site - actually take it down. So I talk to customer service via email and their is no explanation, no offer of any practical help. The only solution they offer is to upgrade my account - effectively buy more bandwidth. It seems I have no option so I upgrade and all this achieves is a slightly longer interval before the increased bandwidth is exceeded and the site is suspended. Then some weeks later I get a message from a Webs telling me in in accessible techno speak that many sites such as mine are experiencing similar problems. Apparently it is all about systems that piggy back on your site to boost the traffic on another site making that site appear more popular than it actually is. In the same message I'm told if I have such a problem then I should contact Webs customer services - but what would be the point? My solution - I'm running down the Website while at the same time migrating the content to Facebook. It is much less hassle, costs nothing and the real bonus is that I never again have to deal with Webs' deceitful customer service who sell me additional bandwidth when they know it will not resolve my problems and offer nothing in the way of practical help.",0,Webs,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/49dad542000064000504300a/198x149.png,http://www.webs.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I worked with Michael Smith at Health Plan One at Medicare Solutions.  When I talked with him about finding a cheaper plan he said that he could find a plan.  I gave him a list of my medications, and he thought a Humana Advantage plan would for me.  It also covered dental, hearing and optical for a cost lower than my present supplement Cost program.I gave him the name of my Primary clinic -- North Clinic.  He told me that it was in network.  He also told me that if I was not satisfied, I could revert to my old Medica Cost Plan if I was dissatisfied. Because I am a nurse who has helped patients get prior auths. I questioned him about this.  He reaffirmed his statement.  I then agreed to register for the plan with Humana. I asked that it start on 8/1/2018 because I wanted to have my card before I started.   After I completed on online register, I searched for my clinic, and could not find it.  North Memorial Clinic was in network, but this clinic was different than my clinic -- North Clinic.  I called Humana and spoke with a customer service rep,  and she told me that I was right .I called Michael back to discontinue this change as I did not want to change clinics after nearly 30 years with my Primary.  He told me to call Humana.  The person I talked to at Humana told me I could discontinue my policy effective 8/1/18, but that I would need to talk to my current carrier. I also discovered that the policy was to go in force 7/1, not 8/1.  I called Medica to return to my policy, was told I could not return to it as it was a Medicare Cost Plan, which was to be discontinued and they could not write those policies any further.  I told her what Michael told me about being able to revert to my previous Insurer (Medica).  The representative at Medica said there no such option.  I called Michael back again; He told me that it was Medicare 12G rule.  I again called Medica back with this information, and was told they had never heard of this.  I then called Medicare, and spoke with a representative about this, and she said she had never heard of this before, and she had been in her position for 5 years, and she checked with her supervisor who also had never heard of it.  The Medicare Rep. then told me she was going to write a complaint of this broker for Marketing misrepresentation.  She also aided me to get my Medica Plan back. I also searched the Medicare manual for 12G., and found that Most regulations have a 12G as a sub rule of the General rule. When I did a search, using various queries I was repeatedly was redirected to the Home Care regs., I have also placed a call to the Minnesota state regulator in the Dept. Of Commerce.  I have spent more than 10 hours on this, and I'm still not sure if I will have a policy other than Humana on 8/1,I have had to cancel my appt with my Primary, and with my therapist and Psychiatrist.  I have had to cancel Physical Therapy as well.  I know that the Hospital near me is in network, so if I have a medical emergency, I will go there.

"They are scammers. They book you at nice low rate (however, not fully disclosing details of your flight, you can only see name of the airline), take your CC and then send you request to call. When you call, they tell you that only 2 out of 3 sits are available at that rate (clearly seeing that I am flying with two kids) and then... oh magic! they did something so now 3 seats are available at $90 more per ticket. When I said that  I am checking right now directly with the airline and rates are lover than you are offering me now and seats are available, they say that's not true, there are no seats at that rate, airlines just did not update it. And then - oh, another magic - they can lover their offer to only additional $50.00 per ticket. At that point it is clearly a scam. Asked them cancel transaction, do not charge anything, I do not agree with this scam. Now I have to watch my CC, making sure there are no unauthorized charges.

From the point of calling to place the order to the point of install. On the phone I was asked if I wanted a credit protection. I said no two times. when done I was transfer to the automated portion of the call and told that in three month I would be bill for the credit protection. During the install I was told the company no longer supply's told for the tech to pull cabling though walls. The choice I was given was to upgrade for a fee to the hopper system. Later I was told it could be done but for a fee of $100 per wall. When the cabling was ran. It was placed on the outside wall in a closet. The wire being drill though to the bedroom. To make the connection to the hopper. During the install a person arrived and claimed to be the installers manager. He took pictures of my tv. With no explanation of why. He also went though the house while the installer explained the operation of the hopper. It made me  feel very uncomfortable to the point of calling dish tv. When I called They were not able to tell me if the manager actually works for dish. The man claiming to be the manager did offer to sell me part to install the cabling in the wall myself. Also offer to hang the tv for me at a cost. Before leaving the manager asked me to give the installer nine on the  Survey that would follow the install. It felt less like asking and more like telling. From what I've witnessed dish tv no longer does installs. They should tell customers from the start. That they will need to buy the hopper upgrade during the sales. And if it's a real practice to send people to check up on installers work. The customer should be advise that there is a possibility of this kind of process. I'm still wondering if that person actually works for dish tv. And worrying that we may be rob in the near future.

"This is a review of the overall corporation and their online business. I always choose arrangements that are processed & delivered by local florists in their network.  I don't want flowers in a box that have been in the back of an hot / unrefrigerated UPS truck for 12 hours.  So I ordered an arrangement that would be in a basket that was to be delivered by a local florist (my mom is elderly, and I don't want her fumbling with a glass vase). I've used 1800Flowers a few times in the past, but they really screwed-up my Mothers Day shipment.  They called the morning the arrangement was supposed to arrive to tell me ""sorry, but the florist has run out of flowers"".  That's like saying McDonald's has run out of hamburgers.  It's FRIDAY morning, 2 days before Mothers Day -- are you serious?!?!?!? Someone in customer support calls me that I can barely hear.  She tries to get me to agree to some boxed flowers shipped by a ground courier.  No vase, no basket, just crushed, over-heated flowers in a box.  She tells me she needs to check on options and will call me back.  This cycle is repeated several times. I finally call a local florist (which is what I should have done from the start), and they were able to fulfill my order ASAP. 1800Flowers was supposed to call me back in 15 minutes.  1 hour later, still no call.  I had to call the customer service 800#.  I got a different person who told me that the florist is not ""out of flowers"", but they are overloaded with orders so they can't honor all the orders that they accepted.  I canceled the order, and will never use them again. Stick with local companies.  You may pay a little more, but who needs this drama & aggravation.  Who knows how many others are dealing with the same problem.",0,1-800-Flowers.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/47ff62cf00006400050240e6/198x149.png,http://www.1800flowers.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Incredibly inept logistics and service teams are doubled down with return/refund policies that are downright criminal.  Before you order, please understand there is a 30%!!! return fee for cancelling an order after 48 hours, one of the most obscene consumer robbery schemes I've ever seen. I ordered an in-stock item that said ""ships within 24 hours"" and got an email the next day that it had shipped....to another facility 10 miles down the road in California.  Where it sat for 8 days without moving. During this time, I placed 3 different phone calls to ask what was happening with my delivery and why it hadn't moved.  Each time I was told I would get a call back with info, and never did. After the shipment finally arrived in my city, more than 2 weeks after I ordered it, I had to then coordinate with the local delivery service, as I had purchased the ""white glove delivery"".  They informed me that it would be another 11 days before they could bring the order out to my house. Working again with the service reps, I was told that my options were to wait basically another 2 weeks, drive to a secured shipping facility with my own truck and pick up the order (they refused to pay for the rental truck), or cancel my order and eat 30% of the order cost. At every step, I was made to feel like I was the unreasonable one for not understanding that they have the right to tell me something has ""shipped"" when it is really sitting in a warehouse for 8 days and hasn't left originating city yet.  And made to feel unreasonable for being upset that once my order made it here and was sitting in a local facility just a few miles away, I would have to wait another 2 weeks, when this easily could have been scheduled while the package was (finally) in transit if there was any kind of coordination with the logistics team or anyone who cared about servicing customers.

Uship offered no assistance and later increased my invoice to include additional fuel costs, even though I drove to freight center that it was eventually located in, to pick the pallet up myself. In my experience, purchasing additional services will not ""guarantee"" anything, and they will take advantage of their customers and void their ""guarantees"".

I went to my local tax preparer and had it done and had all my previous problems solved. For a much considerably LOWER PAYMENT.

"Hi, I had made a booking under reservation number 135272294 for a flat in London and made the payment by credit card for GBP 970/- or so on May 8th 2019. A few hours later I received an email from VEEVE, the property manager saying that the flat is unavailable and that my credit card has not been charged. However, my credit card was actually charged a Service Fee of GBP 77/- by HOMEAWAY.COM under Invoice no USHA13C0022957708 and Order no FYTHPCG as per HOMEAWAY invoice dated May 8th, 2019. So the booking was actually never confirmed but I was charged a Service Fee. I was unable to send any email to HOMEAWAY regarding this issue as I did not see any contact email or phone no at HOMEAWAY.COM. I did follow up with VEEVE who claimed that they cannot refund this amount as this charge was made by HOMEAWAY and not VEEVE. I have used HOMEAWAY several times previously and this is the first time something like this has happened and I am extremely disappointed by the lack of contact info at HOMEAWAY and the  indifferent attitude of the property management company.

I had a really frustrating conversation with a representative today it was very confusing and especially when he charged me he told me I would be charged $25 for a late fee when I have done I have always called you on time I've tried to advise you of my new debit card numbers it's not my fault that they give me temporary debit cards that expire so I have to get new ones and then when I get the permanent card I had to call to let you know about that also so it's just very frustrating it is frustrating to have to go through a non-native speaker and those are really frustrating I had to talk to someone again who did English was not as first language that happens all the time and he got frustrated because I have to go to work I don't have a lot of time to sit around and wait for him to say okay please hold on hold on hold on repeatedly it's very frustrating and I don't appreciate it at all so that's why I gave you a very poor rating today and now I'm going to have to go to direct smile and I meant to talk to someone and try to sort this out it is like I said it's very frustrating you make me not want to do business with you guys and it when I first started I was told no don't worry and everything's fine you know you have no finance charges nothing we just wanted to let get you to smile and that was great I really appreciated it thank,0,SmileDirectClub US,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a9681f1e0e51f0001cb883d/0x0.png,http://smiledirectclub.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I live in New Jersey but hit a pothole in New York state and severely damaged my car it was not drivable. The insurance agent I dealt with gave me extremely wrong information. She told me that no one in New York state was an authorized MJM repair shop and I would have to pay personally the difference between their price and what njm allowed for the repair.  She further told me that if I didn't want to expose myself to Lang out cash to repair my car besides my deductible that I could personally pay the $900 towing fee to have the car towed to New Jersey to an njm approved repair shop.   I thought this was the most ludicrous option in the world and had to get her supervisor involved.  It took one week to get an njm approved appraiser to look at the car before they could begin work. I was stressed out to have my car for over a week in New York state enough that I didn't have to deal with this nonsense and uninformed agent. this is the second time I got an agent that was not knowledgeable and gave me wrong information. I thought in njm was a premier insurance company and I have all my insurance with them.

"DHL is not only unreliable but unprofessional. I worked with this company several years back and they cost me six figures in business because of their inability to deliver on time, and management in Miami and Europe could care less. I thought I would give them another try many years later (6) and the same disappointment that I experienced last time in service and communication I’m experiencing again. A simple delivery that should’ve taken two days is now out at seven days. 7kilo package from Spain to Portugal. Their US and EU can not track European package, their company professionalism is nonexistent. Their senior management could care less about the customers, no call backs when requested, they probably care more about their race cars.

"This is surely outrageous and will tru never to use this company, Bravofly...they must be literally desperate if they are so in need if the people's money.

I called this company and they assured me I'll get a refund, minus some ""administrative"" fees. The total cost was 265,32 Eur and they offered a cash reimbursement of about 35 Eur or voucher of about 73 Eur!!! I gladly donate to many causes, but this one is not donation, but stealing!

"Worse experience ever! They put the wrong size of tires on my car, when I go back to change them they try to put another brand of tires that were of less quality than the ones I had gotten in the first place for the same price of the higher brand I had asked for. The manager tried to argue with me that they were the same quality and price, after I had done my research. When they took off the first set of tires they had put on, they claimed that my wheel studs were broken. What I don't understand is why did they not tell me the studs where broken the first time they put the tires on that same day, the manager argued that we had broken them. It was the worse experience ever, I live 2 hours away, my brother had to drive my mom back home 2 hours, so she could make it to work, I had to stay in Bellflower, CA until the next day because they did not have the tires for my car and had to order them, I tried canceling my order and go to another tire shop but was unable too because they had broken my wheel studs and I was not able to drive my car. We were in the Los Angeles area visiting my grandma,  we were not able to see because of their horrible service. They new wheel studs for free, but did not receive any discount for the inconvenience and the unnecessary money we had to spend taking my mom back home. I paid $700 for the greatest headache.

"We booked tickets a while ago and everything went good. We received an e-mail with all the information we needed. But yesterday we received an e-mail that our airline got cancelled, the route we reserved was no longer valid. We needed to contact the flight agency ourselves and search for a new airline. I always thought that this was the job of the company where you book your flight with. But ok, we tried to arrange it ourselves... When I tried to call to Bravofly (Belgium) I was very disappointed to hear that they could only speak French. Belgium is a bilingual country, so it would be nice if they would speak English at least! Then I called to Bravofly of the Netherlands. I did not receive any help. The only message i got was that we really have to arrange everything by ourselves... Today we tried to call the flight agency of the cancelled airline. We lost almost 3 hours calling to different countries. You can imagine the cost... They informed us that they cannot arrange another flight! They told us that Bravofly should make contact with another agency and look for another flight. We hope the people of Bravofly will do their job now and try to arrange something for us. We are very disappointed in the help we received so far, we hope this message will stimulate Bravofly to do their job and help us. Maybe then we can give you a more positive rating. I think you might need it, considering the average rating... Hope to hear from you soon! Update: after sending e-mails and again calling to Bravofly, we're still stuck in the same situation! Bravofly isn't able to find us a new airline from Shanghai  to Amsterdam. Nevertheless, a little search on the internet showed me that there are a lot of alternative airlines. But no... Bravofly says that if the flight of China Eastern Airlines changes from hours, that China eastern airlines should offer a different airline. Of course there is no different airline and Bravofly isn't even willing to look for one from another agency like KLM. I thought we booked a whole package with Bravofly and I think they should make sure that there is a connection provided between the different flights. If they are not willing to do that, then they shouldn’t sell people those kind of deals. Next to that I think it's just outrageous  that people need to search for a new connection for themselves, isn't that what we pay you for? UPDATE: Hello Bravofly, It’s seems impossible that Bravofly will be able to do anything for our trip. So the only option we’ve got is to ask for our money back. But first I would like to know how this works, how much of our money we will actually get back (because I’ve already read that most of the time people don’t see allot of their money back with Bravofly). Of course I don’t only want to cancel the airline from Shanghai to Amsterdam (the one that has changed), but we have to cancel the whole deal. We won’t fly to Bali if Bravofly can’t arrange to get us back to Amsterdam. So we want to cancel the whole reservation and get the money back of this whole reservation. I hope Bravofly doesn’t pay himself out first with my money, since Bravofly didn’t do any good work for me. After all this drama, all the calling, all the misery Bravofly had put us true, it would almost be fair to get a compensation! I hope this time I will get an acceptable answerl. That would be a nice change after all effort I’ve been through… Booking a trip with Bravofly was the worst idea ever…  I really hope we will be compensated for this failure of Bravofly. It would be the only reasonable thing to do. Thank you for doing your job. You will be hearing from us.",0,Bravofly,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/47ff74ec00006400050242a5/0x0.png,https://www.bravofly.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I have used UpWork for around two years and have spent $10,000s in transactions. To cut a long story short, the account is deactivated and closed - final decision. They mention discussing alternative payment methods since they don't want users leaving the platform. And yes, many people I have hired ask if they can do this, yet I have not done so and my regular milestones support this. They aren't interested. Thus, they've lost me as a customer and have left those I hired unhappy. The outcome? Those I hired are leaving the platform - the very thing UpWork was so paranoid about in the first place. Good move UpWork - your policy must be news to the ears of alternatives such as Freelancer and PeoplePerHour who are welcoming those affected.

"Coinbase has some of the worst customer service out there. For a major online digital wallet and digital currency trading forum, they really have terrible website design, security, and support. The website will offer you log-in options such as ""keep me signed in on this computer,"" or ""don't ask me for a verification code on this device for 30 days."" Clicking the box for these items will make no difference---you will not stay signed in, and you will be asked for a verification code.  Under account settings, I have the option to ""turn off 2-step verification."" I keep this set on ""off.""  Regardless, I have to take 3 or more steps to verify my account every single time I log in.  This includes receiving text messages, emails, uploading photo ID's every time I log in, and taking selfies of my face via webcam every time I log in.  Usually the selfie's fail the verification process, so it takes me about 3 attempts to log in, upload IDs, receive text messages, and take selfie's every single time I want to log in. In attempting to resolve the issue, Coinbase help/support will give you bots until you want to croak. When you finally get a response from a real person, they will ask you stupid questions like whether the ID is valid or whether your phone company is blocking text messages.  They will not get to the bottom of the issue which is faulty, insecure website design.  The help/support team has no idea what they are doing, and the minute you stop responding to them you get an automated message saying ""the issue has been resolved, case closed.""  It's just stupid.

"While UPS is amazing where I live, FedEx has been completely unreliable.  Tracking info is never right, many of my packages are never delivered and a good number just get stolen or misdelivered.  At times, I can be home all day when something is due to be delivered by FedEx and I wait all day.  FedEx never comes (I confirm with my outdoor camera recordings), but magically, tracking info gets updates either to say that I was not home when delivery was attempted or that it was delivered when nothing has been.  When I call FedEx to escalate the issues and tell them that my packages did not make it to me, they ""investigate"" for weeks and then call me to say that I need to contact the merchant as ""they have policies in place to deal with these types of situations and FedEx cannot do anything else to help me with my not delivered package!!!!!"".

"I gave 1 star because I can't give them zero or negative star. Here is what I have experienced with UPS. 1. I have a parcel and  I rescheduled a delivery on Thursday, 30 Nov 2017. 2. At 15:00 on 30 Nov 17, I received an email saying the receiver was not available, that messaged come in at 14:34. But my husband was at home the whole time on that day and he didn't hear any doorbell ring from UPS. After that, he checked our mail box, no card was left in the mail box. At this point, I really doubt that if the UPS driver even come to deliver on that date. 3. So both my husband and myself made a few calls on Thursday and complained to the UPS call center. They promised that they will contact Depo and and get back to us asap. I also asked to speak to a supervisor but then the person who I talked just put me on hold and waited the call to end automatically. 4. On Friday, 1 Dec 17, my husband followed up with the UPS call center a couple of times again. They promised the delivery would be made today as the driver will deliver until 21:00 today. In the meanwhile, we still haven't revived any call from the Depo. 5. At 20:30, I still haven't got my package so I tracked my package again and here is what I see: ""The delivery change was completed. / Your delivery has been rescheduled for the next business day."" None of us requested a reschedule; we even specifically ask for them to delivery today and this happened. 6. At this point, I know for a fact that I will never receive my parcel. 7.This is not the first time issues happened with UPS shipment, it happened almost every single time. I scheduled delivery with them, they never show up and just leave me a messaging saying no one was home. 8. My husband and I have made complaints numerous times with UPS but yield no results. They seems simply do not care about their company reputation or customer satisfactions. 9.

I would not recommend travelocity and particularly US airways. Our flight arrived late in Philadelphia which caused us to miss our connecting flight to DC. US Airways refused to let us board since we only had 20 minutes to make it to one terminal to the next. They said they were expecting us and not to worry. My 15 year old and 6 year old kid were with me and it was a long night because of it. We did not get home until 2:30 A.M. We should have been home by 10. US Airways did not do anything to make us feel any better. They stated it was not their fault it was our fault for not getting there. We waited 3 and 1/2 hours at the airport in Philadelphia. The customer service at US Airways was very poor. They should have given us some free air miles or an upgrade to first class considering this was all their fault.

"I chose to use bookrenter.com to give a smaller company than amazon a chance--it was a huge mistake and not only will I never use them again, I will tell all of my friends and classmates not to use them either. They deserve zero stars. The book came almost a week late, it shipped half the distance by UPS and the second half by the USPS, and somewhere in between it got lost. No matter who I contacted no one would take any initiative in resolving the issue, the absence of the book was beginning to affect my grade, and the best bookrenter could do was issue me a refund--no overnight shipping to rush me a different text. Even though the company is based in CA and I'm in NV, the book shipped from TN, which may have been part of the issue. The title which I ordered from their website is ""Bundle: Worlds of Music: An Introduction to the Music of the World's Peoples, Shorter Version, 3rd + 3 Audio CD's"" and there are other options on their and their competitors' websites that do not include the 3 Audio CD's in the title--that is why I chose to order this selection. When the book came, not only are the front cover, back cover, and spine barely hanging on by a thread and the pages filthy-black as though it has been in the hands of a mechanic at work, it did not come with the CD's. When I contacted the company their excuse was that they legally have to include ""+ 3 Audio CD's"" in the title. I highly doubt this as this is not what the title of this book is printed as either on the cover page or in the Library of Congress catalog. Since both their own and their competitors' websites included the same book as an option Without the CD's, it made sense that this would be included. As a final note, when I ordered my book part of the selling point was that it included free shipping, but the book arrived without a return label so now I must pay for the return shipping myself--the second time this company used false advertising. When I tried contacting customer service with the issues I was having, first online with chat because it was incredibly difficult to find a phone number, and the second time by phone after I was able to dig up the number, the person who helped me was incompetent and unhelpful. The first person was obviously helping multiple people at once and confused my order with another person's. The second person kept having to repeat every sentence I said at least two to three times before moving forward after a very long pause.

"Absolutely disgusting. I ordered a suitcase from Samsonite (their official site). Zero notifications that it was going to be delivered by UPS. Then I received two notes of missed deliveries throughout the week (while I was at work), the one on Thursday saying that I had to pick it up from our local access point. I also got an email from Samsonite saying that it's there and ready to pick it up. I'm heavily pregnant and it's impossible for me to carry stuff alone. My husband and I changed our weekend plans to go pick it up this morning. Surprise, surprise, IT'S NOT THERE. We've lost the entire morning trying to track it through their website, which is completely useless. After absolute ages, I managed to speak to a human person on the phone. Their customer service is EXTREMELY RUDE and told me that apparently it was going to be now delivered to our home address on Monday. Again zero notifications about this, and she was not even able to send me an email confirming this. I seriously can't understand how UPS is still on business and other companies still use them. This is not the first time I had such a horrible experience with them.

"My wife has been using Expedia for both personal and business travel for a long time so much so that she is an “elite member” and gets extra perks such as better customer service. On her bucket list has been Turks and Caicos so she booked a week vacation there in what turned out to be one of the most colossal disappointments by Expedia.  First off they had misrepresented the hotel and then wouldn’t even let us cancel even before we moved into our room. After spending hours on the phone and getting cutoff and having to call back and wait to talk to someone, their solution was to let us stay at the place we wanted to leave in an upgraded room that we had to pay extra for. We didn’t want an upgrade or anything free, we just wanted to cancel and salvage our vacation. Even though my wife spends tens of thousands of dollars with Expedia each year, they did nothing for us. If that is how they treat her then I can only imagine how they treat average customers thinking about using Expedia for the first time.

"I am so disappointed in this store that I finally got my husband to go to. The name is DXL, and they literally did not have one shirt, top or sweater in XL.  Lots available in 1XL - 6XL.  Didn't help us. We were persuaded to order onine, which we did.  The order came and one of three sweaters was the wrong size. We returned the incorrect size and another customer was buying merchendise using coupons.  The salesperson did not offer us anything, and I see online, that if you spend $100, you can get $30 off. We did spend a total of over $100. I'm not likely to buy more from this company, unless someone reaches out to us and makes this right. Ifeel that we were not treated well.  This is not how you make repeat customers. Update: Through online chatting, I was given a cust. service no. to call.  By providing all details of the transaction, I was given a $35 credit towards the purchase. Grateful for that, but wondering why it will take 7-10 business days for the credit to show up on my credit card. New update: 10/20/19 - The $35 credit that I was promised never appeared on my credit card statement. I called cust. service again, and was told there was no info. regarding my refund. The agent said she needed to issue a new 'ticket' and needed my credit card info., which I provided. I'm supposed to see the credit in another 7-10 business days. This is horriblet cusomer service.  I should be offered a lot more than the $35 at this point, for all the inconvenience and negligence. NEWEST UPDATE 10/22/19 - This is part of the email I was sent 2 days ago- ""On 10/7/19 we refunded $50 back to the Visa credit card used at the store on 9/30/19. As a courtesy we applied a coupon which would have given you more savings then the original $35. With the Columbus Day holiday, Tuesday 10/22/19 would be the 10th business day from the 7th. Please let us know if you still don't see the refund after Tuesday. We're sorry the person who you spoke to on the phone couldn't find the refund request.  It appears she didn't check under your contact information."" Attention somebody at your company: it is Tuesday 10/22/19 and I DO NOT HAVE ANY CREDIT ON MY VISA.  Can someone address this?

"Well, Sinemia directly responded to my first review. They fixed my app so that it would let me choose my movie and theater. I thought “Awesome! I finally get to use my service after two months of it failing to do what it claimed.” I find perfect tickets for Avengers. I pick them. I’m about ready to pay the extra $3 fee that they don’t tell you about in the initial sign up.... And it can’t process my payment. I add another card. It can’t process that one either. I’m about ready to throw in the towel and cancel this service to get my money back. It’s been three months I’ve supposed to have a movie a month, and I’ve only been able to see one movie with this service, solely because it just does not work as advertised. They sold a total lie. My rollover movie is probably going to expire and there’s literally nothing I can do about it because they won’t even let me PAY THEM MY MONEY. Words cannot express how frustrating an experience this app has been. I basically have $50 sitting in the pocket of the CEO who claimed I would have a movie a month, and when it comes time to provide, he hides behind an error code.

However when i was taking the test the internet was perfectly fine. NEVER disconnected once from the internet because right after the first 0% I tried again for the 2nd time and also got a 0% without proof I got any question wrong.

"UPDATE: In response to tradesy's canned response below. I did contact you guys and nobody responded to me. I understand you have an authenticity guarantee on your site but the problem here is the buyer couldnt prove that my bag was fake. She only sent a letter to you and that's all it needed for you to rob my earning. She could have had a fake bag authenticated and send back my bag with the letter. I explained everything to you so I dont think I have to contact you again. If at all, you should contact me with my earning to make it right. You guys are shady as hell. In April 2017, I was informed by tradesy that one of my sales which took place back in May 2015 was a fake. It is not. The sales was two years ago, and the buyer did not submit any definite proof that my bag was fake. Tradesy sided with the buyer, withheld my earning for a sales that I made  which was $1199.5 I wrote in back in May and Nikki told me that she understood where I was coming from and promised to have a solution for me but I never heard back. Tradesy had no right to take my earning. They could not provide proof of my bag being fake.

"Ok the thing is we first bought Vivint camera after being told everything should work without paying any extra monthly service fee to Vivint, by a salesman at Bestbuy. Then it turned out that was totally a lie. (The guy has since disappeared from Bestbuy, which was due to termination of collaboration between Vivint and Bestbuy, as I was told by Vivint yesterday. )We had to pay$ 19.99 to have the system working. Fair to say we were tricked into the program? Then we kept on losing the cameras. Most recently, we lost one camera out of totally three, which prompted me to call Vivint customer care. That call before another two totally costed me about one hour or a little less. The result was Two cameras were lost after the Vivint guy rebooted the system. Then I was told a technician has to be sent in to solve the problem. I was left with two options, pay $199 for the tech visit or upgrading to higher service for a free tech visit?By leveraging the co-pay for an upgrade to a service contract of higher  monthly fee ($19.99 to $39.99), do you think I will recommend Vivint to any others after all this “Vivint”experience ?

"Very bad experience. All the other websites allow 24 hour cancellation or change. I asked them to move my dates by 2 days within an hour of booking tickets and they charged 350$ per ticket. More frustration comes in when the price they charged is more than what I see on airline website. But now I cannot book through airline as flybackindia has already reserved seats for me, and if I cancel that now anyhow I have to pay 350$ per ticket more. Agent literally tried to take this non-cancellation policy to his use and charge as much as possible. Never book the tickets through flybackindia, if you even have 0.5% of chance to change tickets and make sure to verify the actual price of the ticket directly with the airline.",0,Flybackindia.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5536db4f0000ff00057eebd8/0x0.png,http://flybackindia.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I booked a hotel through Cancelon for one night in Kansas City, MO. When we arrived at the hotel, we were informed the site had overbooked the hotel (there were 10+ other people in our same situation) and the original hotel was already full on its own. It took 2+ hours of trying to coordinate a new hotel before we were booked in a much cheaper hotel 8 miles from the original hotel and across state lines in Kansas. They did not offer to refund us anything until I called today to demand a refund (during the call the person on the phone kept talking over me and telling me to calm down and relax). We were in town for only one night and to see a show, that we almost missed due to this whole ordeal.

"This is a review that I will update as the service progresses.  I have contacted the company and stated that I will keep this a 5 star review if they unlock my iphone 5s in 1-12 hours as stated. it will go down to 4 stars if the unlock is outside of the 1-12 hours but they send me an email stating that fact so that I'm not left guessing to the outcome of the process. it will go down to 3 stars if it is up to 10 days to do the unlock. it will go down to 2 stars if I get no email responses. it will go down to 1 star if I have to request a refund or the service is not provided. I hope they stay at 5 stars we will see. I ordered at 8:31pm pacific standard time on Friday Dec 13, 2013. Order #53600 Update 12/17/2013 It's well passed the 12 hour mark in fact it's been 3 days without an email or phone call.  I just tried to connect the phone to iTunes and it is still locked.  So we are down to 3 stars with still no solution in sight.  I have sent them one email with another going out tonight. if I don't get a response by tomorrow I will be reducing the rating to 2 stars. Update 12/18/2013 I'm now requesting a refund as I have not heard a single response from the company except that the order is processing which they ""auto send"" right after you send payment which for me happened on the 12/13/2013.  I think IMO they can unlock other carriers and even iphones sold before Jan 1, 2013 but like all the other unlockers out there AT&T in the USA make it illegal to unlock their iphones that were purchased after the 1 of the year (2013) and I think this company is no different in that they can not unlock an Iphone 5s USA AT&T because that model falls under the new rule.

"I just had the same experience as the other reviewers.  Tonwe had two orders tonight. Both were over an hour late. I called the restaurants when it was close to our original window for delivery and one order said it was ""out for delivery "" and the other one said it was being prepared. Both restsurants confirmed that the food had been ready for the driver for quite some time but no one had shown up!  I ordered over a month ago and my order was over an hour late as well.  When i called that time, they said that my order was set for pickup, but i had the confirmation that it was scheduled for delivery.  It seems GrubHub changes the delivery window and the order from delivery to pickup whenever it suits them wlthout notification. They also make it difficult to reaxh them if therr are issues. I had to Google to find their customer service link, which only allows chat.  The first operator asked me for my info to look up my case and then never came back and ended the chat!  The second rep went away for a long tome then told me they would not refund my order. My food was cold and soggy and it was so late, we were too tired to eat.  They said they would give me a 20% discount on my next order but then completely reset the window so i couldn't see my chat transcript.  Of course, no 20% coupon was ever issued, but doesn't matter.  I will NEVER use them again.  The firdt two times i used them was okay, but it has been downhill ever since. Also, as if it isn't absolutely ridiculous enough thst these places charge a fee and then expect you to also tip on top of it,  but their choices to tip as ""suggestions"" start at 20%!  This is not a nice sit-down dinner. Thede are fly-by drivers who are always late and often get lost, as what happened on one of my orders. On top of it, they want you to tip ahead of time before you can see how bad their service is.  Dont tip ahead! Use cash if you have to. Most of the time it doesn't even warrant 10%!  At least UBER EATS lets you tip up to an hour after delivery.   However, good luck with getting in touch much less results with their customer service as well...but they are not nearly as horrible as GrubHub.  I'm so frustrated with GrubHub and their disregard for customer service, and its such a ripoff. They don't refund and it is the same as a scam. I'm going to report them to the BBB and also the state and  county consumer affairs, ans  encourage others to do so as well, given the number of so many negative reviews!  Their service is truly predatory in nature.

I am so disappointed in this rental location! I was rented a vehicle with a front end problem. Front Rotors were bad. Car swirling all over the road when you excell. Hit brakes it rattled like tires would come off. The car is loud sounds like a dump truck. Vehicle needs tune up and service badly. Spent over $300 from nashville to Jacksonville florida return for gas. Never in all the years saw a vehicle drink gas like this.its because it needed servicing! Tried to change at  Atlanta and jacksonville none was available. Had to inconvenience a friend to drive me to miami. Then bother other friends to take me around. I have nothing good to give in a review. I could of lost my life in this car! Am not happy at all. Tried calling rental location. They never answered their phone. i called roadside assistance they tried to help me. for me to get back home to nashville i had no other choice than to drive that  messed up car back it took me 7hrs getting back due to the condition of the vehicle! when i reached nashville  roadside AAA met up with me and had the vehicle towed to enterprise!

"I am an eBay seller and have used PayPal for 10 years. It used to be ok when owned by eBay but since they went independent they are awful for sellers. First of all can anyone explain to me Why I get charged a £14 fee when a buyer says that they did not authorise a transaction? I realise it is a card fee, but as the seller it is nothing to do with me when they say that they haven't made this purchase. Surely PayPal should foot that bill? Also - in this case, just so you actually know how many people abuse their buyer protection which leaves us sellers out of pocket - this buyer bought an item from me on eBay and paid by PayPal. I sent the item. She LEFT FEEDBACK saying she had the item and was happy. A month later she opens a case with PayPal saying she didn't authorise the transaction. I sell items for £3 and it is not worth getting tracked postage so I didn't even contest this and agreed to refund her everything, putting me out of pocket. I didn't even fight and now they send me an email saying I am being charged £14 on top for this! I could understand if she said she had never received the item and I couldn't prove she had but when it was over an unauthorised transaction which she said SHE DID then that's absolutely ridiculous. Why aren't they supporting sellers more and using common sense?? Also, i would appreciate it if PayPal actually read and understood my customer service emails before they replied as I've emailed PayPal in the past and I DO NOT WANT AN AUTOMATED EMAIL that doesn't actually answer my question again. Considering it's the sellers/receivers that actually pay money to PayPal, you'd think they'd be more supportive.

Personally I think the system these companies including CB is terrible for the job hunter. 90% of the jobs I apply for I am either qualified or over qualified for and I barely ever hear a good response.. All of these positions go thru recruiters most of which are kids right out of college and they don't have a clue about experience or intelligence.

For this particular situation I needed a live person to interact with to solve a problem.  Their web site had no such phone number offered.  All they had was a bunch of preset questions on preset drop down menus.  Meaning I was shoveled into certain categories determined only by them, and within these categories were only certain questions also only determined by them.  There was no place (as many other online companies have) for free comments by me, questions to ask not covered by ""those above,"" and for sure, no way to contact them on my own with my own particular concerns.  Indeed using their web site to get my particular concern/question answered was a nightmare-the worst I have ever encountered from an online company, and I have experienced many online companies.  I am looking to disengage myself from these people as soon as I can.",0,Handy,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5433b34200006400057ac616/0x0.png,http://www.handy.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I used Airbnb for the first time a week again and I will NEVER use them again. The Studio we rented was totally misrepresented. When we arrived at the rental we discovered the building was a construction site. The hallways and stairwells were being decorated and the floors tiled. There was dust everywhere, building materials on the landings and stairwells, doors held open with fire extinguishers, bags of rubbish left in the halls.  There were workmen coming and going, and they were grouting the hall outside the rental while we were there. The Studio rental was also directly above a nightclub. The host gave no indication of the nightclub in the description and at no point contacted me beforehand to let me know about or apologise for the building work. In addition while were these the keypad system to enter the building stopped working. We were in fact locked out of the rental on our first evening. It was late and only by the sheer luck of another resident turning up with a key were we able to re-enter the building and get back to our belongings. I emailed and left a voicemail for the host the following morning about this issue and to date he has still not had the decency to contact me.  Fortunately the estate agent next door that managed flats in the building were able to get us a key, however this took over an hour of our time, during which we could not leave for fear of not being able to re-enter. As soon as I returned I logged an issue with the Resolution centre. Again the host has not had the decency to respond to me. I have now forwarded my issue to Airbnb directly, and despite a standard response saying I would be contacted within 24 hours, I have not had any communication from them. Previously I have used Booking.com and Hotels.com for both personal and work and I will be staying with them from now on. They are both excellent services that Airbnb could learn a lot from.  I travel a lot and book a lot of accommodation for work both UK and overseas and this has been one of the worst experiences.",0,Airbnb,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4bea382900006400050aab0f/198x149.png,http://www.airbnb.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I'm so beyond frustrated with the lack of any kind of customer service with sprint. I've been with sprint since 2011. Never had to deal with customer service so I was oblivious to how horrible they treat loyal customers. I use my phone's till they die. Which finally happened to my iPhone 5. Went to the sprint store close to me to purchase a new iPhone. In the process, I was sold a new plan  that would save me some money. I decided on the iPhone 8 and a 60 dollar unlimited plan. I was told I would have a credit towards the lease as I'd been a loyal customer for 8 years. I thought it sounded good. Got the phone set up and left. Flash forward to my first bill and it was not right. Was over charged and didn't know why. I went back to the store and spoke with another employee and asked him to explain my bill and he couldn't. He also said they hadn't changed my plan like they should have so I was still being billed for the previous plan. I asked him to adjust my bill as it was it was their fault, not mine. He told me he couldn't do that and I'd have to call customer care. Don't know why they call it that. They should call it. ""customer abuse line"" there is no caring that goes on. I called and spoke to a rep with s heavy accent and was told why my bill was so much and even though it made no sense to me. And they wouldn't adjust. I decided then and there j was going to pay off this devise and go else where for cell plan. I went to the store and asked then if I could pay off the phone and my final bill to go else where. He said, ""yes,I could pay off the phone and call customer care once again and they would unlock my phone. I paid over 600 dollars and went to call to have my phone unlocked. Spoke to another rep who said she would out in a ticket and it would take 24-48 hours to unlock the phone. I wait a couple days and went to sign up with metro PC's. They tried to switch Sim card and I was told my phone wasn't unlocked yet. I thought it may be  couple more days but called to verify once again was told I hadn't waited long enough and by the following Tuesday the phone would be unlocked and ready. I didn't want to wait to switch so I went ahead and ported my number with metro and my plan came with a free Android phone. I could that phone for a few days and they update Sim card once phone was unlocked. I waited past the time the time they told me to make sure to was unlocked. Went back to metro to have them changed the Sim card. When they tried, it still wasn't unlocked. I called cs again in the store and spoke to yet another rep. She proceeded to tell me my phone wasn't going ever be unlocked as it's sprints policy that you have to have your phone active for 50 days before you can have it unlocked. Even if you pay it off. I was beyond  frustrated I asked what reason could they possible have to keep my phone locked. If already changed carriers and I owed nothing to sprint. Was told that was their policy and nothing could be done. The only thing she suggested was for me to have them active my iPhone with sprint again and give me a new number and wait out the remaining 50 days. I told her she was nuts and I didn't want to have to pay for 2 phone plans for the next 20 days. She said,that's all she could do for me. She would call me later to find out if I wanted to move ahead with reactivation.  I tried to explain that I had spoken to 3 different people before and not one informed me of this ridiculous policy. Infact told me they were going to unlock the phone. Had I not called, I would still be waiting for my phone to be unlocked. I called back today to try and get someone else and see what if anything could be done. Spoke with yet another rep, she said ""looks like all I have to do is out in a ticket for the unlocking and it will take 2  days and my phone will be unlocked. I asked her why the supervisor for the other night said she had put in a ticket and it was denied. That is if she were to simply repeat the process of putting in ticket for un locking, why would they change and do it for her and not the supervisor. She just kept repeating she was going to put the ticket in and it would work. I knew this was wrong and told her I didn't want to kept going through this. I'd already wasted hours repeating myself and not being understood. I asked or should I say begged to be passed on to her supervisor so I could make sure it would really be done. She didn't was to do no it, tried hard to have me just try her way and see what happens.  I knew better and wanted no part of that plan. I did finally speak to a supervisor and she said"" oh, I just need to escalate this and tell them to unlocked it"". That I didn't owe them anything and they should unlock the phone in 6-48 hours. I said I tried the night before to argue the same thing to the other supervisor and she was not having it. Told me that was all she could offer and no way around policy. I told her it was not right how I was treated. Felt like I was a prisoner and did something wrong. When in fact I didn't. They should have given me correct info so I could make educated decision.  I've wasted hours trying to talk to someone who could help me. I'm hoping what she's promised will happen. She said she would call and update me on status and when they will unlock the phone. I don't think I've ever had worse more confusing customer service interaction in my life. You pay your bill for years and once you decide it's enough and you want to switch, you're treated like a piece of trash. If anyone ever asked me, I will never recommend sprint to another soul. I can't believe with all the bad reviews, something hasn't changed. They only want your money. Could care less about you or holding your phone hostage. I know is s long post but needed to vent my frustration and warn everyone to steer clear of Sprint!!!?",0,Sprint,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46d41691000064000500b91c/198x149.png,http://www.sprint.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"We placed an order in November, 2017, for blood red grapefruit and honeybelles.  At the time, a 15% discount was advertised for purchases, and when we went to the check out page, our MERCHANDISE total was a little less than $90.00, but when the shipping charge was applied, the cost was in the next category: $34.99, instead of $24.99.  I checked the shipping costs page on the website and the page clearly said that shipping was based on the ""total cost of merchandise.""  We could not get the page to change the cost, so we placed the order, then called Customer Service to review the purchase, and the apparent incorrect cost for shipping.  Then the fun began. The first person I talked to tried to be helpful, but was caught and could say no more than that the posted shipping costs were what they were.  Yes, the costs were based on the total cost of merchandise purchased, but shipping costs were based on the total retail price of the order, regardless of any sale prices.  I pointed out that neither the order page nor the shipping FAQ page said that; both said shipping was based on the total cost of ""the merchandise.""  She admitted that she could go no further than her explanation, and offered to transfer my call to 'my supervisor' if I was unsatisfied with her explanation. I was placed on hold, then disconnected.  I called back, explained what had happened to a new representative, and was placed on hold to await a supervisor.  When I explained the issue to the supervisor I was again told what the policy was: it was based on the total price of the merchandise ordered.  When I reminded her that the total price of ""the merchandise ordered"" qualified for a lower shipping charge, she countered by saying it was based on the retail price of the merchandise, not the purchase price paid.  I again pointed out that the website DID NOT SAY THAT at any point, nor was it mentioned on the shipping policy page.  The next tactic she tried was to say that the shipping charge was based on the weight of the merchandise ordered, not the purchase price.  I responded that the website did not say that, either.  Then she said that was something that ""the computer people would have to deal with, but the policy was the policy,"" and could not be changed.  I said it was misleading to say one thing and mean another, especially when there was no information on the website it indicate what she was telling me.  That's when she said, ""the policy was the policy"" and she would not make any changes.  I responded that this would be the last order I placed with Hale.  She said she was sorry to hear that, ""but if that is the way you feel, then I have nothing more to say."" I would point out in closing that Orange Ring, based in Orlando, also features sale prices on its merchandise.  The difference is that Orange Ring posts its shipping prices on the order page, right next to the items offered for sale.  I know immediately that if I order three trays of Indian River grapefruit what the shipping cost will be--it is posted right next to the purchase price.  Hale claims to base its shipping costs on the TOTAL COST OF MERCHANDISE, and does not post the cost until the end of the order process, where the shipping cost MAY OR MAY NOT reflect the total cost of merchandise ordered.  This is a deceptive business practice, and we will not place an order with Hale Groves again.  I am aware that in the grand scheme of things, a single order may not be a big deal to the company, but it is to the affected customer.  I am only sorry that the stated policy for shipping costs is both deceptive and inflexible.  The company could do better.",0,Hale Groves,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/591caf910000ff0005a2a8be/0x0.png,http://www.halegroves.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Last spring I rented from you a textbook. You got it and I originally had no problems with it. It was slightly damaged, but I didn’t originally see any problem with it. At the end of the semester I waited for information on how to return the book, but I never received anything. I then saw a charge on my card that I had bought the book for $227 or so. I was very frustrated at the fact that I had just “bought” this book because of this company’s incompetence. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I see this book and decide to see if i can sell it. I look and see that you guys buy back books. The book wasn’t in the greatest shape, but I figure since you guys sent it to me like this and it shouldn’t be an issue. I mail it out, and a week ago I receive it back in the mail and i get an email saying that it wasn’t in good enough shape. This initially made me pretty mad since it had come in the same shape as I had received it back. However, this wasn’t the end of the story. I then take it out  of the package and try to sell it to the bookstore on campus. They go to inspect the book and the binding was ripped off the pages of the book. Not only do I now own a book I didn’t want to have, but now I can’t sell this book. I have looked into re-binding, but the cost isn’t what it needs to be to make it worth my time.

We called our hotel directly and they said they let the company know weeks ago and on several occasions they were booked, however, we only heard from them the night before. The “manager” we spoke with gave no options and showed no remorse for their companies poor service. On our own we researched and were able to find a comparable 5 star resort that was available and he refused to book us. We spent two hours on the phone with no resolution and are now out the cost of our flights, arrangements for our dogs etc. As well as heartbroken we aren’t able to celebrate a very special time as we had planned. We travel often and have never experienced such terrible customer service. I am appalled at how we were treated and how horribley the situation was handled. They made no effort to make this right for us, even after we did all the leg work to find a reasonable solution. First and last time we will ever use this company and advise everyone to avoid it as well.",0,Cancelon,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/589cd7880000ff00059c669f/198x149.png,http://cancelon.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

Loved the support it would give BUT I walked around and jumped up and down to test it and the cinch to tighten at the shoulders was already irritating my skin. I can’t imagine trying to run with that irritating me the whole time. Also the front is very unflattering under shirts and tanks. Many lines and the zipper covers add to the bulk (unnecessary in my opinion). I like wearing light/shear tanks when I workout and this bra front is bumps and lines galore. Would not recommend if you like tight tops over the bra. This bra would be great if the front was flat (still with zipper) and they had tighteners for the shoulder in the back.,0,Shefit,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5bc4d4053a10040001a46fc8/0x0.png,http://shefit.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I called to make a revision on a round trip flight. Something simple, just extending the date of my return, which was listed as the same price online. First the rep told me that the flight wasn’t available... even though I was looking at the flight on their website and had the option to purchase directly. Then, she said the flight suddenly was available, but I would have to pay over $200 to change it... even though I booked less than an hour before and both return dates were the same price online. There wasn’t even an exact price, just “$100 admin fee, between $50-$80 extra, and an additional fee from the airline which we don’t know.” No other solutions offered. When I asked to be transferred to another rep, she refused. I asked multiple times and finally she hung up on me. I called back later and after being on hold for 45 min, someone answered.

Don't buy this. Buried in the terms of service is an auto renew feature that they automatically recharge your credit card annually. They don't let you know they are about to charge again and when I noticed it on my credit card statement a couple of days later - they said sorry you have to pay for the entire year. Great business to be in. There are plenty of reputable providers of this type of service. Go there and save yourself grief.

"I have used Ebay probably as much as the average since 2003. The website has never been that user friendly but primarily as a seller now it is very complex and time consuming.

"Uber is a total fraud! I was quoted a fare for £34-£48 from Towerhill to Heathrow when I reserved it, but instead I got charged £108! The journey took nearly two hours, 7:20am-9:20am. Plus a cancellation fee of £5 for the previous Uber driver at around 7 and knocked on the wrong door- I did not get a call at my door yet I got charged for their mistake! Their system -the app let you rate/review the driver first and requests a tip then it shows the cost of the fare. I think it probably is ok if you order and and take the ride there and then but not to reserve in advance and to have the cost of fare to your account, they'll charge whatever they want. The driver said he couldn't tell me how much the fare costed when he dropped us off at Heathrow T4 - he must have known how much the fare was but was too embarrassed to tell me. I didn't get a chance to check it until I got home couple hours later. I contacted Uber for a refund and got the usual fob off. Zero for customer service! DO NOT SIGN UP AND HAVE YOUR BANK CARD DETAILS BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT DELETE IT - can not delete an activating payment method! Absolutely ridiculous! I'll have to cancel my card and get a new one if I want to get ride of them! It my personal information yet I can not delete it when I want! Avoid at all cost!!! I contacted my bank but Uber has their own t&c which means you can not challenge the cost of fare no matter however ridiculously over the quoted price. I won't be using Uber on my account again!

"I would like to emphasise how poor most of the airbandb accommodation is. I have used airbandb many times and every time there is something wrong. People should not rent out their homes/rooms in their home if (a) they are not going to not bother to make an effort with their guest and instead just make them feel as if they are invading their home, (b) not going to bother to clean the room, the bathroom, the hallways - the whole house basically and they don’t provide adequate heating because they feel the house is warm enough or they don’t like it too hot, (c) they are easily irritated by people’s reasonable behaviour (eg getting up early/leaving a light on overnight/using the bathroom at night etc). These are small things but they should be the minimum standard if one is paying for a room. After all, we are paying guests, the hosts are not doing us a favour by allowing us to stay in their home. To top it all off guests are then invited to leave a review and most people leave a polite one, ignoring the problems rather than being honest because it would a personal criticism. You can’t tell someone that their home is dirty! But that’s how I’ve ended up staying in places that were filthy but which had glowing reviews about how clean the place was!

"So, I bought a very expensive face lotion (Epionce Renewal Facial Lotion) on black Friday.  I didn't need it then, but I figured - I will, so why not buy it now while it's on sale.

"Ordered an item from Bradford Exchange. Arrived when they said it would. Looked nothing like the picture on their website, the picture was obviously changed to make it look more appealing, plus the mechanics of it didnt work so i sent it back. In the meantime i had paid two payments for this which i was assured would be taken off the new item. The new item arrived and worked but still didnt look like the picture. In the meantime a relative ordered am item and knowing that we would have someone in our house for delivery, she sent it to my house. Bradford have now taken it on themselves to merge the two accounts together and use the money i paid to pay off the other account. They refuse to speak to my family member as the account is mine, which it isnt. The billing addresses for the two accounts are in two different towns but somehow they think its the same account. They wont transfer the money back over, wont speak to my relative and now i have an item from them which i wish i had never ordered. Absolutely shocking service and will not be ordering from them again. I have emailed and just keep getting apologies but no one is actually sorting it out.

"I've liked ourbus in general, but on this past ride from NYC to Ithaca the driver drove really fast and a bit erratically, and made me nervous.  I was really tired, but every time I closed my eyes he seemed to swerve around other traffic in such an aggressive and swerve-y way that it woke me right up with an adrenalin shot each time.  By the end of the trip, I saw him yawning, sighing heavily, and squirming around in his seat a bit, which made me wonder if he was wide awake.  The whole thing made me uncomfortable -- and particularly so after the recent bus accident by a rival company on that same route.  I'm not always a huge fan of Greyhound, but I do feel like their drivers drive more responsibly and professionally than the discount buses.  I was hoping Ourbus might be an exception to that.",0,OurBus,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/59a84de10000ff0005aa1f5e/0x0.png,https://www.ourbus.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Update #5 (02/17/18) Paypal ruled in my favor, and I got a refund. They emailed me even, even after I told them case close, don't contact me again. The email says in part: ""Kindly leave a phone number so that I can personally speak to you and explain your refund. Please be advised that we have already processed a full refund and we would like to get your feedback so that can rectify your additional concern as soon as possible.I share your concern. Correcting this situation is both of our interests.""  I got a refund, and now they're harassing me. Update #4 (02/15/18) FINALLY they refunded me! After all the lies and delays, they refunded me!! Probably because I filed a claim against them with Paypal Update #3: (02/14/18) I received an email today that says ""I need to inform you that according to our Policy if a PayPal Claim is open we cannot make any movements in your order (THIS IS A COPY & PASTE ANSWER) Unfortunately this is why the refund process is taking so long."" THIS IS A LIE- THE PAYPAL CLAIM WAS OPENED AFTER THEY'D ALREADY BEEN STALLING/LYING/MAKING EXCUSES FOR A WEEK! Update #2: (02/12/18) THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM!! Endless excuses why they haven't issued a refund! I just bought a house, and that entire transaction took fewer emails and a LOT less time and aggravation that lousy $40 for a piece of silver plated jewelry! Update #1: (02/11/18) AS I CLEARLY STATED, it's not the $13- they are apparently desperately in need of it, the issue is how long it's taken, how slow they are to refund me, and the incredible about of emails needed. (I first requested to cancel January 19th, as of February 11th I am STILL waiting). ""Sandra"" got back to me asking me to change this rating and I said no, because it is accurate, truthful and fair. I have a right to warn others. Keep the lousy 30%, just sent the balance and leave me alone! (02/08/18) I canceled an order very soon after placing it on January 14. They charge a 30% ""restocking fee"" for returned items, but they still charged me for it, in spite of the item never being made. Fine, if you need $13 that badly, keep it. I have already had to email them 10 times to try to get a refund. It was like trying to break up with someone and they won't accept it.

"I drove my nearly 79-year-old mother from visiting her goddaughter into downtown Toulouse to return my rental car after five days and encountered bad traffic.  Also, instructions as to what to do with my paperwork were unclear and there was no further information on the top level of the garage where the car was to be parked.  By the time we got Mom and our luggage down in the elevator and to the office, shortly before noon, everyone had checked out for lunch hour and the office was just being locked up.  I don't know for sure, but suspect we were 15 to 20 minutes late.  Because of this, the Toulouse office attempted to charge me more than $200 for an extra day.  This has left a hugely sour taste in my mouth, even though Visa managed to negotiate part of the charge back.  Obviously not one second of grace is accorded by Auto Europe, at least in Toulouse, and no allowance is made for not being able to hand the car back in to a person (and thus be clear on exactly when it was returned) during the sacred dejeuner (lunch break).  I've been a customer of Auto Europe for a long time, half my family is in Europe and I'm back there at least once a year, usually twice and sometimes more, and I usually book my rental car through them.  It hurts (and shocked me, I admit) when what seems an extortionate charge is levied because of a brief delay in returning the car (FULLY fueled and in perfect shape except for normal road dirt), and certainly influences me to think about booking through some other agency (though I doubt they're any better).",0,Auto Europe US,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/47ff62d2000064000502410e/198x149.png,https://www.autoeurope.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"1. My experience at the store itself wasn't comfortable. The guy at the store didn't seem to be happy receiving me. 2. I asked specifically for cricket sunglasses. I told him that I was going to rely on his expertise as I didn't know exactly what kind of sunglasses are worn. 3. He told me that the glasses are not available at the store but he can help me out with online store, which was ok with me. 4. He told me to buy an Oakley sports glass. That costs around 6k. I asked him again can I wear this for professional cricket. He confirmed that yes. 5. He told me that he'll call me once the order is received at store. Within 7 days. 6. Even after 14 days I didn't get any call. 7. This time I verified online and with my other sources about the purchase I had made. I got to know that it's not a cricket specific sunglasses. 8. To clarify more on this I called your(lenskart) customer service. The lady(Beauty Paul) at the other end mocked me with her sarcastic tone when I asked if you people have any expertise on cricket sunglasses. She told we don't sell separate sunglasses for hockey, football, etc . 9. I called again to them to complain against the misbehaviour. They told me that I'll be getting a call back from their expert 10. I got a call from Kailash, he again tried to sell me a cricket sunglasses from their catalog. I asked him about the size which was L . He confidently lied about the product size that it's a free size and I can go ahead with the purchase. 11. I checked the product images from your own app where it showed that any person wearing M or L size t-shirts should buy M size sunglasses. This completely contradicts with what Kailash had told. 12. I called the customer service again for a refund. He arranged a call with the store to which they told they'll be sending an email where I have to give my bank details. 13.

"I booked a reservation through Travelocity at the Holiday Inn Express Suites, Amarillo, Texas about two months in advance.  Yesterday I found out that I would not be able to use this reservation after all.  I called Travelocity and spoke with someone who sounded as if they were in a foreign country and spoke with a very, very heavy accent.  When I tried to cancel, they told me that all three nights that had been prepaid would be forfeited ($317), even thought the reservation isn't until 3 weeks from now.  When I asked to speak to a supervisor this person would not let me do so.  They referred me instead to Holiday Inn, who they say keeps the forfeited deposit.  I then called Holiday Inn's central reservation line, who referred me to the Holiday Inn Manager in Amarillo and/or Travelocity.  I then spoke with the local Holiday Inn Manager, who referred me to Travelocity.  None would refund the deposit. While I understand a reasonable cancellation fee to cover administrative expenses, charging $317 cancellation fee is anything but reasonable.  I urge all readers to not book any hotel stays through Travelocity or at the Holiday Inn.",0,Travelocity,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/46d6ca37000064000500e2cd/198x149.png,http://www.travelocity.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

We have a light blue carpet and have been left with orange stains made by drips from the stationary machine there are a good few of them to......and they appear in no time before your eyes. After speaking to a nice lady in customer services they checked the stability of the chemical batch and said it was fine. They also suggested we purchase even more of their products to try and remove the stains left behind. The company have no reaction team to visit households that experience problems. We will show good faith and try the suggested method of removal by following customer care advice. We have been told if this does not cure the problem there is nothing else they can do. I beg to differ and will take this issue further until we get satisfaction either by the offer of specialist cleaner or exchange of carpets!!

"Where to start? We traveled over an hour to check out pools and ended up buying one. We financed it, made a down payment and set up a delivery date for 3 days later. (Pool must be delivered before you are put on install list). Two days later they call saying we didn’t sign the right paperwork and they can’t deliver until it’s signed. We take off work, rush down there to sign ONE paper AND only ONE of us had to sign. Seriously, why couldn’t  they just send it with the delivery people?? We  then ask if the pool will fit in a full size truck, they say yes so we decide to save the delivery fee and pick it up  ourself. After 2 hours of loading, I can tell you, no it does not safely fit in a full size truck! 6 weeks later installation guy calls says he will be at my house between noon and 2. I leave work at 11:30. He calls at 11:40 to say he is at the house, I tell him I am on my way, I will be there in 15 min. He didn’t say anything was just a little huffy. I get home, I ask him if the filter can go a certain place, because we already have the proper electrical outlet at that location. He says that’s perfect. His word: perfect. Install goes on, they leave, I have water delivered, go to plug in pump and can’t plug it in, it’s too far from the outlet. Really?!? So gotta have electrician come out, pay $140 for that. The electrician even asked me why they didn’t set the filter 1 more foot closer, I didn’t even know how to respond! 2 days later we get in the pool, only to find a rock, a sharp one at that, poking up through the liner. Now this pool holds 23,000 gallons of water and cost me $1100 for that water. I am now waiting for them to come out and see what they can do about this rock. They will be here   July 27th. Another day to miss work. I really wish I could just go back to June 3rd and stop myself from starting this whole mess. I know they have been in business for quite some time but it sure seems like every contact with them has been a screw up. Update: I was contacted by the store manager and he was very apologetic. He has gone over and above to compensate us by giving us credit for next years chemicals for the pool.

Being put on hold for 100 minutes while I was trying to cancel within the time was a huge problem. It took over 3 hours total and three calls to finally resolve it with a supervisor. It was the same old problem receiving spin and no problem over and over when there was a huge problem and no resolution until a long time on the phone with the supervisor. It was an experience I do not want to repeat due to customer service and reps being non native English speakers from the Phillippines who do not understand the language well enough to understand the question let alone solve the problem.

I just realized that my system was arming without even connecting to the Ackerman server.  How can you be allowed to arm the system and it not even connect with the main security system.  If someone were to break in only God can help me.   I usually get messages that I am not unable to arm because maybe a door is open or something like that.  This is far more important and didn't even get a notification.  The only way I found out was because I accidentally set the alarm off and forgot to turn it off for 10 min and didn't get a call from Ackerman security.  When I called Ackerman security they said I was notified of this issue but never addressed it.  What?  They said they called me!  No they didn't!  They even had the nerve to charge me for them coming over to fix the communication issue which later they waived after speaking with the manager.

Terrible experience. I ordered a front bumper and spent close to $800.00. Contacted the shipper to schedule a delivery between noon and 3. Took time from work on the day of the delivery and driver calls at 12:45 to tell me they forgot to put the bumper on the truck. They tell me give us two more days to get it to you. I then take another day from work get my delivery and open the box to find they have sent a rear bumper. I ordered a front bumper! Call customer support and they say please send it back and will send you a new bumper. This will take about two weeks. I have returned the bumper but not yet received my refund. During this time I also ordered $80 worth of additional items from ECS. I have never received those items. I am current out $900 and not one item from ECS to show for it.,0,ECS Tuning LLC.,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/481734b80000640005025ca4/198x149.png,http://WWW.ECSTuning.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Extremely disappointed with EzStorage.  The company has extremely poor practices which are not in the best interest of consumers. (1) Military service members personal information -  they collect unnecessary personal information from service members (like SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS) which the military moved away from as a tracking mechanism for third party, non-DOD entities, in order to protect us from identity theft.  What's even more alarming is that EzStorage will not and does not provide how they safeguard information. Most reputable companies will provide this... EzStorage does not. (2) DO NOT RENT STORAGE UNITS IN THE STORE!! GO ONLINE! PRICES ARE ALMOST $70 -$100 cheaper. You would think that the representatives would tell you that you can save money by reserving online but they do not. Once you are locked into a contract, they will not honor online prices.

"We have been using Hotels.com primarily for bookings in Australia over the last 5 years or so but our recent experience with an overseas booking leaves us frustrated and very angry over their non-existent customer service. We have just returned from Poland and had booked and fully paid in September 2018 for accommodation in Krakow for x4 nights.  We also contacted the hotel just prior to our departure from Australia to advise our arrival details and no problems were advised. Approx. 7-10 days prior to our scheduled arrival we received an email stating that the accommodation provider had cancelled our booking due to ""urgent maintenance issues"". No alternative accommodation was advised and we were simply told to contact Hotels.com. This was very difficult to do as we were travelling throughout Poland and English is not readily understood. In addition, we had lost our mobile phone and this created significant difficulties for us to be able to ring Hotels.com. That is when our nightmare started and we ended up having to book our own alternative accommodation at significantly increased costs due to the urgent nature of our request. We are now back in Australia and, despite at least 20 emails to and fro from Hotels.com we have still not even received a full refund of our pre-paid booking and we have been told that they will not entertain any other compensation. Their staff do not have English as a first language and they simply do not understand basic English grammar,expression and nuances so communication with them is always difficult. Further, despite their assurances that you are a valuable customer, they do not assign one staff member to assist you and we received emails from different people on almost every occasion. This would not necessarily be a problem except for the fact that whenever we were contacted the staff member had not familiarized themselves with our file. In fact, on one occasion, they actually stated that they could not locate our file. We are going to initiate legal action for their lack of support and failure to provide a service that was fully paid for back in September 2018.",0,Hotels.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/46f82454000064000501a675/0x0.png,http://www.hotels.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"In Canada, Sinemia is in maintenance mode (for better virtual cardless system) for the last 2 weeks. No one, including reddit members are not able to buy any tickets. The new app is also invalidated my gift card that has $55 on there. This is also confirmed with 2 other people, once the gift card is applied, an error message in Turkish would show and the card is invalid. Sinemia said they are unable to help when there is no balance. It is ironic that a company that tracks everything yet cannot track gift cards usage? It is impossible to spend a gift card when the whole Canada doesn't work. I am very upset with this company because they are not delivering the service they promised. Also the customer service is not in position to help and blame the end user. Update 1: Sinemia reached out and I have submitted the information demanding the gift card balance to be reinstated and restore functionality for advance ticket purchasing. Let's see how they are going to handle this. Update 2: Sinemia reached out by twitter claiming I can buy ticket. I tried to buy ticket with my 3rd gift code, after the same ""maintenance error"", the code then expired. I took a screenshot before redemption and I cannot believe I was lied to. There has to be a problem with Sinemia end and they could not figure it out. Update 3: It's been 3 days and I have not yet contacted by Sinemia even they reached out in here. The missing gift card balance is still not resolved. Update 4: It's almost a week and they can only give me the ""we are going to contact you after we fix this"" on Twitter.

"Lugless.com is a straight up scam and you get what you pay for. You are better off paying 3xs as much to ship through UPS or pay the $75 at the airport to take the bag. My experience with Lugless began over a month ago when I moved from DC to CA. I decided to ship 5 bags through lugless, mostly full of my clothes and some sentimental personal items that cannot be replaced (family heirlooms, gifts and handmade cards, etc.). First off, Lugless did not get me the shipping labels in time, so the help desk had to email me copies of them with no directions. I taped all of the labels on the bags (no direction for which label should go with what bag) and no directions for how it will be picked up. Mind you, I paid an extra $118 for the PREMIUM protection and coverage. The ""promise"" with that premium coverage is lugless tracking and on-demand assistance. Fast forward a week, the day my luggage is to arrive. I hadn't heard a word from this business, even though they are supposed to be tracking my shipment. They wait until the day of to tell me that 3 of the 5 bags haven't had tracking updates in days. Not surprisingly, 1 of 5 bags arrive and the other 4 are missing. I had spent $300 total for this service, and they only delivered 1/5 of their promise. I, personally, had to contact UPS (again, even though I paid this terrible company to be doing this for me). Lugless did not pick up the phone, even though I attempted to call twice during their business hours. I personally had to request UPS open an investigation, at which point, UPS told me I have to speak to Lugless directly as my (god awful) liason. I had to keep prodding Lugless to follow up and give me updates, which I don't feel I should have to do because why the hell did I pay for this service if I have to initiate. They could give me very little update other than ""We're sorry. We know this is frustrating."" I sent them a description of the bags for the investigation. UPS STILL contacted me directly for follow up because, you know, why even bother with this liason. I followed up 3 times to inquire about when the investigation will be closed so I can move forward with an insurance claim and I also demanded a refund for their poor service. They were unwilling to give me resolve on either front, continuing to blame UPS. They claim the premium charge ($118) was non-refundable, even though their service was far less than premium. Now I am stuck in a conflict with them, as I have resent my itemized description of luggage contents for the UPS claim. I sent it in 3 different emails and lugless kept coming back claiming the body of the email cannot be seen. This took me to a level of frustration I was already on to incomprehensible rage. How in god's name can I send this description 3 different times and your team keeps saying you can't even see it? I assumed it was a game they are playing, as they couldn't be specific as to why the ""email cuts off"" and a mechanism to continue to drag their feet. I am still waiting for support and resolve in this matter. I am at a complete loss. From my perspective, I made this huge and challenging move across the country and arrived to over half of my wardrobe gone (including work clothes for my new job) as well as years of sentimental things I've collected to bring with me. I paid extra for Lugless to take charge so it would be one less stressful thing to deal with during this challenging time, but I wasted my money. I paid to have these precious belongings still in my life, but I mine as well have given $300 to a junk man to throw it in a dumpster. This has been one of the most emotionally draining and deeply depressing dealings with a business I have ever had in my life, and I am convinced Lugless doesn't feel the least bit of care about that fact.

"I have been an Amazon customer for years. I have never had a problem until today. I received an email that my order had shipped. Unfortunately, I hadn’t ordered anything. I contacted Amazon to tell them that they had charged me for something I didn’t order. The first representative spoke such broken English that I had to ask for someone else. That representative told me they were sorry, they would contact the seller and when and if they heard back from them, they would issue a refund. I told her that wasn’t good enough, and she argued with me. I asked for a supervisor, who told me the same thing. When I told the supervisor I would cancel my account over this, he transferred me to the our-of-country seller, where no one spoke English. I call back and asked for a supervisor. I had to ask for a second one because the first one barely spoke English. This one told me to call my bank. I called a third time. This time, the supervisor finally said she would reverse the charge, but due to her very poor English skills, she was telling me she would reverse it in ten days when, after about ten minutes of asking every simple way I knew how, I determined she meant she was reversing the charge immediately but my bank might take ten days to process it. I am a pretty tolerant person, but when I call customer service from the USA, I want to speak with someone speaking coherent English. I have also NEVER before had Amazon refuse to make something good immediately. I should not have had to have spent an hour trying to recoup funds for something I didn’t order. I never order from third party sellers, and certainly not from a seller that is out of the country. They could have verified that by looking at the hundreds of purchases I’ve made from them over the past ten years.

I placed an order on April 27th. Today is May 11 and I have heard nothing about my order even though the money was taken out of my account immediately. Calls go to a voicemail and may or may not receive an answer. I got ONE callback that said the products were to be shipped by the 7th and would be received no later than today. That did not happen.

"This was my first time using Groupon for flowers. Usually I use Pro-Flowers. I saw a deal on Groupon for $20 and free shipping on flowers. Little did I know, this was just a ""discount"". The flowers through the shop, in my opinion, is astronomical. I paid Groupon $20 for the flowers, and then Blooms another $22. $42 for lower end flowers (without a vase mind you) to be delivered on Mother's Day May 12, 2019. While ordering these flowers on May 11th, 2019 through Groupon, it had given me a choice for the date of delivery. Of, course I chose the next day. After paying for the item, I received a notification that it wouldn't be delivered until Monday the 13th. Okay, no big deal. One day late. Then the evening of the 13th, I get a notification from Blooms saying the flowers will now not be delivered until Tuesday the 14th. I called into customer service to ask when the flowers would be delivered. After a 40 min wait, I finally got in touch with a representative who said it would be delivered to the physical address sometime today. Now, a time frame would be nice to know. Having flowers sitting outside in the cold or heat will ruin them. Customers, who bought flowers as a gift , can't expect them to stay home all day until 5 pm. To be delivered. In conclusion, I am disappointed in the service. I paid more than I would if I had gone through Pro-Flowers, they deliver on time and on the date promised. I will not be recommending this Groupon code or service from this company.",0,Blooms Today,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/47783f3e0000640005020bae/0x0.png,http://www.bloomstoday.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I used to love Apple products and have been an avid buyer for the last decade (multiple iPhones, MacBooks, iPads, beats and an Apple TV). My most recent experience has made me never want to purchase another product. I purchased a MacBook Pro in 2012, which wasn’t cheap, but when spending $2100 on a computer you would expect it to be quality. Boy was I wrong. The laptop all of the sudden would go to a gray screen when turned on and wouldn’t load from there. I looked up the issue online and found that this is a common issue with the 2011/2012 model of the MacBook, and Apple actually faced a class action lawsuit in 2014 over the defect, in which they offered out of warranty replacements from 2015-2016. When I brought it to the Apple store they ran a diagnostic test and confirmed that it was the defective video card. The Apple Genius informed me that the company considers my laptop obsolete and they no longer make the part so there are no options for repair. He immediately recommended that I just purchase a new laptop. Why would I ever want to buy another MacBook from a company that considers the device obsolete after 5-7 years and won’t even fix it if you pay the out of warranty repair price. All buyers beware any Apple product you own will be considered obsolete 5-7 years after release and will not offer any repair options after that point. There used to be a time where they would repair any model of any product but those days are long gone.",0,Apple,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46aa1826000064000500920e/198x149.png,http://www.apple.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"I'll attempt to keep this brief. I purchased tickets for an event that cost roughly $30 each. It's completely understandable that there will be ""fees and service charges,"" as I am relying on the convenience of purchasing these tickets while sitting on my couch at home. Imagine my surprise when I am charged an extra $10 for each ticket. When I contacted the company via their chat, I was given rehearsed answers for why the fees exist, at which point I was told it boiled down to profits. TicketOffices.com admitted that they charged me roughly 1/3 of my ticket price so that they could make a profit. I would strongly suggest using another service to purchase your tickets, as many will only charge you a small fee for each order and not a fee for each ticket (even when its within the same order).

It looked as though the pictures would wrap around the cup and we’re going to be much larger. When I received the cup, the pictures were so small and only on half of the cup.

If the preview turned out the way I received it, I never would have purchased it. This was a birthday gift. When my fiancé opened it I told him that I was so sorry on the way it came out and that the preview looked completely different on the website.

"Two month ago I purchased new account then I configured asus router with openvpn client, tried with tcp and udp, tried with uk,german,france,netherland servers.All connected, few servers not worked or not responded.My original isp speed is 50/16.But when I connected with vpn got max 16/14.Tried also win app but same result.So contacted support by live chat and also 20 times email support.They not resolved this problem.On live chat got answer: As I tried all the possible steps with you just now and we are still unable to increase your VPN speeds so thats why I suggested that I may then transfer the case to the 2nd level support..from email support got answer :Thank you for reply. Hope you are doing fine today. We apologize for the inconvenience you have faced so far, You are requested to join us on Live Chat and mention the Ticket # 1139826 so that the concern person can assists you accordingly...so I dont understanding what I did wrong..Im not monkey!..when I asked about remote support by teamviewer got answer all engineer is busy..after 2 month got answer by email from pure vpn : Dear Customer It is to inform you that speed is a variable and factor and changes time to time. It cant be controlled as there are other users and bandwidth of a server is shared among all the users on it. Moreover the speed you get depends on many factors and technicalities like transit nodes between your network and our VPN server, existing noise, etc. This is because the network traffic usually travels around the Earth from a user to a VPN server and then back to its destination. Note that when you are connected to the VPN you may not get more than 1/3 of the connection speed due to Encryption...so I asked about refund money..again answer: Thanks for contacting PureVPN support.

"Facebook was a useful tool to communicate at the start, a way to share information and keep in contact and meet new people. And the service did not cost any money, but people did not understand it was not money you paid with but your personal information that could then be sold on to the highest bidder, and when they did understand they still used it. Facebook claimed to be a platform, a town square where all views could be aired and discussed, this meant they were not responsible for the content posted on their site, so if some views led to people being harmed they disavowed all liability, but then they started banning people for wrong think, those people that did not think in the far left manner, those people that resisted and went against the narrative published in the Media or spouted by Leftist Governments. They started to censor people. Labour & Conservative MP's started pushing Facebook to do what they say to follow their ideological rubbish, then they started blocking what people said, ban people, even delete posts that dared to mention certain names or post pictures of them. Then came the mass bans of people that did not follow what Facebook wanted to do, the election meddling started, not allowing people to have their democratic voice even if they had not broken any rules. Facebook turned from a Platform to a Publisher, a Publisher is responsible for what people say on their site, Facebook would be liable for the death threats, fanatical incitement to violence and the liable statements made by companies, political parties, newspapers, media channels, comedians and everyone else that posts. Facebook are now a publisher not a platform, and they should be counted as such by Governments and Organizations across the planet, you cannot have it both ways Facebook, you want to control what is said then your a PUBLISHER not a Platform who is interfering in Democratic Elections and CENSORING valid opinions. Facebook will claim some people have broken their terms of service, just look at Far Leftist or Religious fanatic pages, see the vile comments, death threats and incitement to violence, Facebook are not censoring these people. If you like Freedom of Speech, then leave Facebook and join Telegram, Minds, Gab and Bitchute, let Facebook disappear into the void of the internet.

"At first glance, Tilebar seems great. Modern website, great looking titles and designs, but, when it comes to service they completely fall of a cliff. My advice to management, who I could not even speak to when I had a complaint because the CEO is too good to speak to anyone, is, fire the majority of your sales people and start over. I went in for design consultation and didn't get any, when my order went through I got the wrong tiles, and a good amount of them were cracked. The customer service/sales person was not competent enough to figure out our problem, and I could not get this fixed for days. Luckily, our tile person was able to figure something out. Personally, I think Tilebar could potentially be a good company but it's not as of today, and for that reason I would not be a repeat customer. Good luck.

"I placed an order online and received two confirmation emails with different order numbers. I emailed customer services to question this and ensure that only one order would be progressed.  My email, sent to the published customer service email address, bounced.  I checked the address and tried again.  Bounced again.  I sent 3 or 4 in total - all bounced.  I phoned the published cust services number *a lot of times*, including several calls during office hours, but my calls were never even answered - they all just eventually went to voicemail.  I left two messages requesting a call back.  Nothing.  In desperation I tweeted them with a query.  Nothing. I have now had one order fulfilled, which was quick, and is exactly what I wanted, and I have been charged for just one order.  Great. But I have heard nothing whatsoever about the other order.  No response to my emails, voicemails and tweets, no cancellation email, nothing. I love the classic Baracuta clothes, but I have never experienced (a lack of) customer service like this before.  I work in ecommerce and I am genuinely amazed - the least I would expect is an email fobbing me off!  But a cust service email address that doesn't exist and a tel no. that screens its phone calls?  Are you kidding?  It's unbelievably unprofessional. In fairness, they successfully and quickly fulfilled my order and charged me corrrectly.  But the customer service side of the operation seems to be literally non-existent, despite massive efforts on my part to reach them.  On that basis, I could not recommend them at all.

In theory this is better than being late. Except that the golf course we were shipping to - like many golf courses - had a policy that they can only store clubs for 48 hours in advance. This is why we used shipsticks because we could select our exact delivery date. So when we did, and then they arrived 4 days early, you can see where we had a problem.

I booked an apartment like an hour ago. We talked on the phone with the owner and then I realized that the location is completely different than the one shown on Airbnb and much further from downtown so I decided to cancel. I requested a call and Daiana called me just now and she assured me that I will get back all 81 euros of refund. When we finish the call I receive an email from Airbnb that I get 70 euros!!! It is not my fault that the owner put the wrong location on the map. Now there is no option to write an email to airbnb or request a call. Every time I tried to book with airbnb I had a problem.

"There was no friction as I had zero interaction other than calling for book delivery etc.   The biggest problem is that the program I completed should not be online only since computer network security requires hands on experience.  While I learned the concepts, I had nowhere to try them out.  You should outline that a certain PC with certain system requirements/software etc. is required since we can't play around with security concepts on a working laptop/PC at home or work.  It needs to be a dedicated machine, off the network too perhaps.  The biggest disappointment was that the BOOKS ARE ANCIENT AS ARE MANY TOPICS COVERED!  While basic security concepts remain current, A LOT OF THE INFORMATION REFERRED TO WINDOWS 2003/XP!!!! That's ancient in IT.  The books are not updated for today's world.  12-13 yr old concepts are useless.  Without any practical, hands on experience, I really didn't feel like I could apply what I learned...which is the only way to really learn.  I had no idea who to call if I had a question.

"Oil change itself was OK.  However, I used $24.95 Car Care Package which includes ""Top off fluids"", not being sure what specific ""fluids"" were covered. (1) They sent me a photo of the power steering fluid which seems a bit lower than it should be, but they did not do anything about it (they did not even mention if the power steering oil was included or not under the definition of ""fluid"".  (2) They forgot to turn off the ""Maintenance Required"" warning lamp.  I noticed and asked but they said it did not work.  However, right after that, I brought my car to my maintenance garage, and they could easily turn it off by the usual oil change process.  I wonder if the Tire Depot mechanic did not even have that simplest knowledge on how to turn it off, or just forgot to do so. (3) They did not place any sticker (or even did not peer off the previous sticker) for the next oil change timing.  This was my first time to see it was not done. (4) The coupon package also stated several other services to be provided but I did not get any explanation about its status nor any documents of being them checked (Air pressure, Battery inspection,  Inspect belts & hoses, Inspect brakes, tire tread).  The only description in the receipt shows they did the oil/filter change and tire rotation.  Actually, when I brought my car to my maintenance garage right after that, the power steering oil leakage was due to the tightened hose just below the fluid container which Tire Depot mechanic has taken the photo.  This means, they did not even checked that ""hose"". This store was my second store under Tire Depot, and I have experienced unsatisfactory service in both stores.

"They don't care if your sneakers aren't authentic after the 3 day grace period even if their policy states they offer Assurance of Authenticity, which is highlighting that the sneaker you receive could be fake. In fact, customer service blew me off when I brought this up after seeing my Jordans Retro 4 paint chip apart after a few wears. They're making it sound like the quality on a sneaker made in 2012 is the same as 1992, so i'm going to consult legal advice about this situation because something don't smell right. -------------- GOAT: Hey there, Thanks for reaching out and providing those photos. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do in terms of a refund or credit as the damage occurred to the sneakers after they had been worn. Since this is more of an issue with the craftsmanship and durability of the sneaker, it's best that this issue is taken up with Adidas/Nike. Our service guarantees that the sneakers will be 100% authentic and in the condition as described upon arrival, and any issue that occurs due to wear and tear is something that should be taken up directly with the manufacturer. Thanks, Samantha ------------- ME Hello, So I want to make sure I got this right. The paint of the sneaker is chipping with less than 5 wears and you’re not at all concerned if the sneaker i received is authentic, even if your policy covers “Assurance of Authenticity” (which is pretty much saying that there’s a chance the sneaker people buy can be fake after purchase) So, where in the agreement between seller and buyer does it state that coverage in damages of the products through the purchase of a third party that guarantee’s authenticity will be covered through the manufacturers? I’m not trying to start trouble with you all. I’ve purchased quite a few sneakers from GOAT, all of which I typically collect as a small hobby and this is the first sneaker with paint chipping. We make mistakes in life, it makes us human but could it be possible that the ONE sneaker I got and barely wore, with paint chipping off could be fake? or are you already determining that my sneakers are authentic because this is an issue that happens often? It’d be crazy news that GOAT’s response was so vague, they’re almost giving the impression that 1. buyers have a chance of purchasing fake sneakers (as it’s written in your policy) and 2. Jordan’s 4 Retro sneakers peeling is a normal thing, according to GOAT customer service. Last time I had sneakers chipping was in the 90s. i’ve purchased a few Jordans. This right here is a first. Let’s do the right thing and fix this situation. Don’t blow me off like that. ------------ GOAT Hey there, Thanks for reaching out to GOAT, 1. The shoes were verified to be 100 % authentic and were verified with no flaws to be present on the shoes at the time of verification. 2. You purchased the shoes back on 11/25/18 and based on our policy there is nothing that we can do in terms of credit or refund as it has been past our 3 days policy. 3. The reason why you see cracking and chipping on the paint on the mid sole is due to the age of the shoes. These shoes were released on 11-01-2012. Based on the age of the shoes they are considered to be ""VINTAGE"" and prone to have issues of age. With all that said like advised we will not be able to do anything in regards to a refund or credit. Sorry about this! Thanks, Samantha --------------- So ya'll can go ahead and make a judgment call. The quality on sneakers from 2012 isn't different from the quality sneakers are made with today. The fact the paint chipped off wearing them 5 times SCREAMSSSSSS these are fake after wearing them. The reason why they're not going to cover me is because the cost of these sneakers are high and nobody wants to cut the reimbursement. This is going to cost you more than the price of the sneakers and the way social media works today I'm not understanding why any company would take the risk but okay, i'm game.",0,G O A T,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5a8be715e0e51f0001cb6b07/198x149.png,http://goat.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I have used Freight Center several times.  This last and final time, I ordered a pickup.  It wasn't a rush, but I needed it gone the day requested.  It wasn't picked up and I never got a call.  The carrier had been switched from the one I requested.  When I inquired about the pickup, I was informed that the carrier I was assigned only did pickups in my area once a week.  Had I known that, I would have requested to go with the carrier I had originally requested.  The reps with Freight Center apologized and set up a new pick up with the carrier I originally requested.  Which was fine.  My shipment got picked up.  But what upsets me is that several days later, the first shipping company shows up to my office to pick up the shipment.  THEY WERE NEVER CANCELED.  I find out that this is a very small local company and this happens to them all the time.  I was told by the Freight Center rep that they had canceled it but got no apologies and got a very blase answer about it.  Due to their non or miscommunication, the small, local shipping company wasted their resources on a nonexistent shipment.  Being someone who has owned small businesses, they don't have money to throw around.  And due to that, I just can't - and won't use Freight Center again. My Response:  Your company keeps claiming it canceled, but I don't think the company would waste its resources and gas to pick up a shipment if they had received the cancellation.  The owner said this happens to them all the time.  I got a very short and trite ""it was canceled on * date"" and that was it.  I am very dissatisfied with the lack of taking responsibility on this and that is why I will never use your company again.",0,FreightCenter,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/56166dc90000ff00058426ce/0x0.png,https://www.FreightCenter.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

Horrible experience. Went in to buy a couch we saw online and when we went to go pay the price was almost $500 more than what it should of been. Asked to look over the bill before we paid and found several things wrong. The salesman added a sleeper to couch even though we told him we didn’t want it. Then he added the insurance without asking. He priced our couch at regular price instead of the sale price and on top of it all he ordered the chaise on the wrong side. When we pointed everything out it took him 4 attempts to fix it.,0,The RoomPlace,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5a45595eb894c90b281df090/0x0.png,https://www.theroomplace.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"The web site had serious flaws. The drop down menu malfunctioned - it usually (9 times out of 10) disappeared every time the cursor was placed over the option for bids. When my bids were able to be selected, currently open bids were shown in the past bids section, which meant I was unable to withdraw bids even one hour before the item was auctioned. The only question is whether these flaws are due to incompetence, or a deliberate design flaw intended to prevent bids from being withdrawn, which would be a criminal offence in most jurisdictions.

Once orders are returned to sender we're unable to re-ship orders out. Once it been received we will process the refund for you."" and when I called to understand why exactly that the courier received the incorrect address they said that you didn't put in your street number :) why in the world would I not put a street number and why would they process the shipment and take my money and waste my time if the address was really missing from the first place??? this is so stupid & I'm sure its their fault!!!!

"Need a mattress delivered so you won't have to sleep on the floor? Consider another delivery service. ""Five-star express delivery"" is a poor name for theirs. We scheduled our mattress's delivery two weeks prior to our move-in date to our new apartment, scheduled for the day we would move in. We scheduled for an afternoon delivery - oh, boy. We were under the impression, from the sales associate, that our delivery would be scheduled from 2:30 to 3:30 pm the day we moved in, which was perfect - we ensured our bed frame was ready and awaited the call one hour before the delivery would come. Well, we waited until 3:30 pm and finally called RC Willey... and then came to learn that our delivery wasn't scheduled until 10 pm to midnight that night. Be sure to read the fine print on their receipt with your order, as it states your delivery time will be available either after seven pm the night before (morning delivery) or after 1:30 pm the day of delivery). Complicating this debacle even more, I finally got a call from the delivery driver at 5:47 pm informing me that our delivery would come from 10 to midnight that night. (They were supposed to call just an hour before delivery - something seemed fishy). We end up waiting, having now made a makeshift bed ON OUR FLOOR next to our set-up bed frame, until 12:30 am. NO CALL. No voicemail. We headed to bed. Next day, I check the order status and the mattress is now scheduled for delivery IN ALMOST TWO WEEKS. We were never informed the delivery was re-scheduled. We call customer service at the distribution center and have our mattress delivery re-scheduled for the same day. I asked the customer service rep to please give me a call to inform me of the delivery time when it was available. I never received a call. Thankfully I was able to check online. Our new scheduled timeframe was 7-9 pm. However, we could have easily fallen into the same situation as the night before with a 10 to midnight timeframe, as the time they schedule your delivery is based on a lottery system. Our mattress finally arrives at 9:40 or so pm, a little later than the timeframe we were given of 7-9 pm. The delivery drivers, because we asked, were not the same crew as the night before, and one of the drivers made a comment that the crew from the night before was known for cutting deliveries short. Additionally, we learned the delivery drivers are paid by piece, so if they want to cancel your delivery, they can and do not need to inform you. AND they have delivered items as late as 1:30 am. We scheduled delivery with RC Willey due to their superior mattress return policy and $59 all-year delivery fee, but won't trust their service again if we need a mattress to sleep on the same day as delivery was scheduled.",0,RC Willey,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/56fbdf7d0000ff00058ad17f/198x149.png,http://www.rcwilley.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"After doing my research I ended up purchasing 7 gift cards at a discount to purchase some funiture.  As a Google trusted store I knew my purchase would be protected.  After receiving my gift card codes I went to use them to buy my new furniture.  To my surprise the first 2 codes had a zero balance.  Then the next 4 worked.  Then the last and highest value code didn't work.  I guess I could sort of understand if one code didn't work, accidents happen, but for almost half not to work is seems negligent/fraudulent.

Since I was ordering one LP I decided to order more. My order processed & shipped normally. Upon receipt the box (unopened) was wrapped for Christmas. When I opened the package I discovered that the LP I wanted (the main reason I placed my order) was not in the order. I called Oldies.Com and was told the item was out of stock. Their website still showed the item for sale (and still does). When placing my order I was not told the item was unavailable, if I had been I would have cancelled the whole order. 2. Another LP had been water damaged and had mold on the sleeve and record. I spoke with Oldies.com and returned the item for replacement. However, they did not replace the item (it is still in stock on their website). Again Oldies.Com did not communicate with me.

"Just bad customer service.  First they gave us the wrong lift tickets.  To correct the problem, and get access to the chairlift I had to get back in line at the ticket counter.  Then they couldn't, or wouldn't help without the physical receipt. Not the confirmation email on my phone, not the purchasing credit card.  So I went to my car, found the receipt and came back to the line.  Then they canceled and replaced my lift ticket, but wouldn't give me my wife's.  They suggested I pull her out of her lesson and have her come to swap out her lift ticket.  It was a huge waste of time that I could have been on the slopes and all they did was give me what I paid for originally.

"Horrible customer service at Viking Bags. I needed just a lid to replace the one I damaged on my Viking saddlebags which had been custom painted. They do not sell just lids, so I had no choice but to purchase a whole new set of bags, just for the lid. Which I did. I was never advised that the model I had was discontinued, and I placed an order in good faith, received the bags and the lid does not fit. Therefore I am obliged to custom paint the whole new set of bags which is too expensive for me to do. Being a Canadian client, I have already paid a high percent rate of exchange, duty, taxes, shipping etc.... and I called asking why I had been advised to buy new bags when the lid would never have been able to fit. I was misled. The customer service said if you don't like the bags, ship them back. This is not the way to handle customers. I don't want to ship back bags at my expense for another $100 dollars and again loose money on the exchange rate from Canadian to American dollars. They don't care at Viking. They have no skills at communicating with their clients, they refused to help me find a solution or to even accept for me to ship back the bags at their expense, considering I was never told that my original model bags had been discontinued. This company is horrible . I do not recommend any out of country purchase, as if you have any problem at all, they do not care and will not stand behind their product. They never told me the bag was discontinued. They allowed me to purchase expensive bags that would not fit with changing of the lids, and they don't care at all that I am out of pocket approximately $700 . They really don't care about anything. Their customer service is 0 quality . There is no care factor. Highly do not recommend.... low end service ... very low end.",0,Viking Bags,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/4e695559000064000510f280/198x149.png,http://www.vikingbags.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Sure it's a great idea.... As an owner After putting my truck up for rent...a nice guy rented my truck. mid way into the rental I got a call that he clipped a curb and busted a wheel and tires...I wasn't mad I know accidents happen..I just wanted it taken care of... so ""I thought"" Turo would handle things promptly, entirely, and correctly....since my truck was a money income for them to get it fixed and back in use. The renter was great and got everything taken care of for the tow truck. And I got all the info right away to Turo and my truck was taken to an official Ford dealer to have fixed. They assessed the damages at just over $1k to fix and had to ship in a new wheel. I sent everything to Turo right away and told them the Truck should be done in 2-4 days. And that I needed it back promptly since I'm losing days renting or having a truck myself. Turo put me with a ""specialist"" to help...Tiffany Barbadillo. She sent me an email stating they would start the process with their ""claim estimator"".  After I had already sent the estimate/invoice from the official Ford dealer for repairs. Well....the end of the week came and no word from Turo Tiffany. She doesn't make phone calls apparently I wonder now if she is in a foreign country ""support"" because I've tried to reach her and she is never available and never returned any of my phone calls...I've asked for a return call and still nothing. Ford had my truck fixed last week now. And I tried calling numerous times and asking for a manager and nothing...the emergency line of support says they don't handle claims and can't do anything and insure that I will get a call from a manager or Turo Tiffany...aaaaaaand nothing not even a manager. They apparently don't work weekends at all also... so my truck was stuck at the dealership all weekend fixed. Monday I get an email from Turo Tiffany stating the claim estimator never got the photos from the damage of my truck and she would send them to him now. Poor poor communication from Turo. I sent her the photos a week before. She said she would ""give me a call"" the next day. Well no phone call still. I get an email from her stating the estimator came in at $334 which is shy $700+ of the actual cost. And that they will send me payment as such. And that if it's more that I can now have the estimator talk with the Ford dealer to hopefully get the costs covered??? ridiculous Turo!!! Tried calling the estimator and closed not available. Turo...why would you not have this better under protocol. And have the estimator call Ford way before on this. I gave you the estimate/invoice from Ford the week before.  So now I'm stuck still without a truck...I had to cancel another rental that someone wanted to use my truck so I lose out on that income. And I'm stuck in the middle. Don't have my truck. It's stuck at the dealership. And you don't want to cover the actual costs that the renter did to my truck????!!!!!  I have to wait till tomorrow to see how this continues?? I will come back and post a review of an update and see how long this takes Turo to fix and get my truck back. And I will continue to post 1 star bad reviews until this is taken care of correctly. Turo Tiffany....you still haven't answered my questions from my emails. I still have not gotten a call from you. And I still want to know how to get reimbursed for a rental costs for myself?? Horrible Horrible Support!!!! CEO/Managers/Owners of Turo...you need to create better support teams for your company that handle customers and especially owners of vehicles to get things handled promptly and correctly. be back tomorrow....and the next....and the next...if it takes that long...until it's resolved...1 stars all the way home.... --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thx for the reply Turo below...but it's still not resolved..and I don't know how to reply to your comment here other than edit/add to this post. Day 10 without a vehicle.... I did receive an email from Turo Tiffany...and she did give me a phone # now. hmmm..tried calling went straight to voicemail and it said she returns calls within 24+ hours. Left yet another vm for you TT (Turo Tiffany). You have yet called me now on day 10.  Here is the response email I got below: --------------------------------------------- Hi Daniel, I've reviewed the estimate that you have submitted from Ford. You have replaced two tires and will only cover the cost for the damaged tire, so one tire is included in our estimate. Also, we have applied betterment for the tire. Since the tire tread had 35% wear, then we will pay for 65% of the new tire. Ford has replaced the wheel and our appraiser determined that the wheel could have been repaired. We will only cover the cost of the repair to the wheel and not the replacement. For the car rental reimbursement please send me your rental reservation and invoice so that I may review it. If you need to reach me by phone my number is (520) 277-5325. Thanks, Tiffany --------------------------------------------- So now I'm at a loss for words here. Turo's ""insurance"" that I chose on my car says ""zero-out of pocket"" coverage on claims. ""1 million dollar insurance plan""  and here is claim from a renter that I had no doing of myself. And they want to cover 29% of the actual repair/replacement costs. TT you couldn't have called me on Day 1 when I sent you that Ford repair estimate/invoice and said we barely cover jack repairs and will only have used replacement tires and sanding/painting over a cracked wheel. Sure that will make the wheel back to where it was before??!! really?!  I'm sure you would love it if your husband/boyfriend brought you 29% dead flowers and band aid'd them up a bit and said I'm only replacing the flowers you had before. huh?! TT, and Turo....you waited 10 days to tell me I have reviewed your estimate and you don't want to pay for the fixes??  I'm stuck I don't have the extra funds to pay for the excess. Hence why I was renting out my vehicle to make an income. And now it's stuck in the shop. Awesome.  The official Ford dealer ship said they recommended the new items for the best repair and safety of the vehicle and to continue normal use otherwise the wheel was compromised and 1 new tire would put the truck off balance. TT I'm renting a car from a friend....so lets see how this goes...I don't have a rental reservation. Just paid them cash. starting day 5. Day 1-5 I took uber and also filled up a friends car with gas for my rides. Are you going to reimburse for those also? It would be nice if you just made things easy on your ""customer"" who make you money to have a $300 week car rental amount. You can also deposit to me promptly?? So I'll put in another call to you TT and see how the rest of this goes. And I will come back and post here the next days that I don't have my truck. I'm going to see if there are any other review sites also.

"Flight canceled (they brought a smaller airplane which could take only first 33 rows of the former plane), was told remaining passengers get the opportunity to choose another destination (+ return flight) AND a 250€ compensation - according to EU laws - to cover the canceled accomodation.

"VBeware of their booking mobile app - it is designed to fraud your money. They scammed me for £280. I attempted to use their mobile app and was charged 4 (FOUR) times for 1 transaction. When I tried to make a booking, the app displayed a message 'the card payment hasn't gone through', so I retyped the card details, thinking I made  a typo, the same message appeared, so I switched to my debit card. After having received a third message 'The card payment has been rejected' I moved on to my laptop. The payment on the laptop has gone through fine. You can appreciate my surprise when, a week later, I discovered 4 transactions from Wizzair, 3 of which were for different amounts of money, and when I logged in to Wizzair, there were 4 bookings for the same name, same flight, same date and the same hour. So, according to Wizzair, I'm going clone myself 4 times,. Summarising, they owe me £280 for 3 of those transactions. I emailed their customer service, but no response for 8 days and counting. They say if you have an urgent issue you can call them but... the calls cost only 77p per minute!! Nice way of making a few extra bob on top of what they've scammed out of me already.

"The Rug Doctor STINKS The first rug doctor I picked up at Wall mart failed to extract any water from  the rug during the first 3 gallons applied. After exchange, the second rug doctor extracted very little water from the rug leaving streaks of dirty water all over the rug. The time I took for the extraction process was better than 3X longer than the time I spent on the application. The idea was to extract as much of the dirty water as possible. IT FAILED. Then I did an entire  process of extraction ONLY (applying NO liquid) and the machine extracted no liquid at all. With all the windows open & over a period of 3 days, My wife & I used 8 large rolls of paper towels to mechanically extract as much water as possible.

"It started out with them telling us to be ready at the hotel for pick-up by 6:05 (hope to see you there comment from the driver) and the bus didn't end up arriving until 6:50am, which means we had to wait for wayy too long. Overall it was a good trip for the short amount of time we had available due to the long drive there and back. On the way back we stopped at a lot of great sights to take pictures which was great, but on the way there he told me I didn't have enough time to use the restroom and I would have to wait another hour. We did two more 15 minute stops in that time, none with a restroom available, which made it very uncomfortable for me. Our driver was nice, but seemed quite confused on how to operate the bus (mic was on without him noticing, turned the heat on instead of a/c, lots of rattling of the bus, and almost let too many people on the bus on the way back which lead to confusion and people afraid of not finding a seat). He also drove very fast and a loooot of swerving and lane changes (I felt very unsafe and scared, especially on the way back, since we almost got in an accident where he passed a semi and then had to slam his break in a traffic jam).

"Pay Pal appears on the surface to be a convenient method of making on line payments, and certainly whilst it was still owned by Wells Fargo this was largely the case, although actually speaking to a human operative when things do go wrong was never easy. Since the sale to ebay however, customer services has degraded massively and several of the companies policies are, at best, highly dubious.  The companies tendency to almost always side with a buyer even when the buyer is pulling an obvious scam or when the post office confirm the seller did send the item, the item was delivered and in some cases even when the post office provide evidence that the buyer even signed for an item they later claimed not to have received, has naturally lead to a huge increase in fraudulent charge-backs and buying scams.   If you are a seller be very, very careful indeed whenever accepting payment via this company. This charge-backs scam has become particularly popular on high ticket items such as laptops and so  on, and in the space of one week 4 separate sellers that are on my Face Book list fell for the same scam.",0,Paypal,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/46ca451b0000640005009529/198x149.png,http://www.paypal.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I would have rated Jensonusa at either a 4 or a 5 as I was happy with my orders.  i'm rating them lower at a 2 because i'm disappointed in the way that returns work.

"Horrible!  I saved $2.00 over the big booksellers, who's names I knew and trusted, to purchase from this unknown company.  It showed up on some aggregator list as the best price for my book.  The website claimed the book would ship within 24 hours of payment. I ordered the book on 8/15, and as of 8/22 it hasn't shipped.  All of my other book orders have already been shipped and received. I called their direct line about a dozen times on 8/20, and received a message that ""all service employees were busy, please call back later.""  I finally did reach a live person. She seemed helpful and gave a semi-plausible (The book was being drop shipped from the publisher) explanation for the delay.  She offered to upgrade the shipping and put me on hold.  When she came back she said the order was already in the shipping department, so the shipping couldn't be upgraded.  She assured me the book would be sent the next day.  It is now two days later, and the book hasn't shipped.  Worse, they have changed their phone message so that there is no option to speak with a representative.  They offer a ""chat"" on the website, but there is no mechanism for this so called chat.  There is only a page that allows you to ask a question about your order, but it is not live by any stretch.

"1800Flowers has to have the worst customer service.  I ordered flowers, that were shown online, to be delivered February 6, 2019.  The flowers were not delivered and were not available any longer.  1800Flowers offered to replace the original flowers and make delivery on February 9, 2019. The replacement flowers were not delivered either.  I called to cancel the order and have my money refunded.  After spelling my name for the millionth time for the agent she stated that my order would be canceled.  By the way, I was put on hold for 33 minutes.  I called again on February 18, 2019, to find out that the agent was confused and did not refund my money.  I was told that the refund would be processed in 5 to 8 business depending on my bank.  That time has now lapsed, so I called again today March 11, 2019.  I was told today that it will take up to 1 or 2 billing cycles to have my money refunded.  I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor.  However, the supervisor always seems to be on the phone or not available.  I know because I have asked for a supervisor before and they never seem to be available.  This has to be the worst experience ever.  I will not ever but flowers from this company again.

"Background (short version): We booked a flight, Bangkok-Adelaide, back in July 2014 with departure date March 5th 2015. When we checked in to the flight everything was fine, at the stopover in Kuala Lumpur we got the information that the flight was canceled two months before and there was no connecting flight. This is on Air Asia’s, but they had informed Bravofly about the cancelled flight, that was on record and  I read it. Bravofly had failed (not even tried) to notify us about the canceled flight. The problem/complaint: When I arrived home I immediately contacted Bravofly and explained what had happened, the woman I spoke to was quite rude but promised me to look in to the matter and contact me with a solution. I expect to get some kind of compensation because the canceled flight cost us one night accommodation and new flight tickets. It’s now over two weeks since I spoke to Bravofly and I still haven’t heard a word back. It's time to take some responsibilities and come up with an soloution!!

"This company has completely gone downhill. The return system was down for a month and customer service wouldn't acknowledge that was a problem. I've spent an absurd amount of money with Groupon over the years.

Definitely do not recommend buying any of their goods especially if it's a final sale. It is a final sale for a reason. I would recommend buying a restaurant or spa deal because Groupon doesn't have anything to do with the actual service you receive.

"""Columbus Day Sale"" Experience, Would have been nice to know the 20% Columbus Day sale isn't credited/ taken off the existing sale package price. Then the sales associate calculates the estimated cost based on existing sale package price, giving incorrect estimated cost. Literally had associate add up prices, quoting me totals that were vastly incorrect, directing attention away from actual pricing used. Accordingly not crediting the 20% off, toward total warranty pricing, and initially not applying warranty to entire furniture package purchase. I became so fed up with the constant issues, double pricing, I declined the warranty. It seemed I could never get a straight answer, with associates trying to hide the true pricing of the furniture, in addition to warranty pricing, and applying 20% Columbus Day sale to entire bill. Somewhere in the fine print, which was never able to be shown to me, the 20% Columbus Day Sale was taken of original price, not he advertised existing sale price!  At no time was this explained, displayed, until cashing out. Imagine my dismay when we were at an 800 dollar difference from original estimates. I have had previous experiences in which I was satisfied with the customer service, as well as furniture quality! Unfortunately this was not one of those times. In the staff's defense, they were never rude. Unaware, misinformed, negligent in correctly/accurately answering  questions asked, ... yes.... resulting in confusion and mistrust .... yes.... Due to vast online competition, as well as traditional chain stores, why deceive a customer that has already committed to buying furniture previously/currently. The cost was never the issue, the principal of deceit, with smoke and mirrors trying to hide the costs was very poor/unprofessional. The reason I completed the rest of my furnishing needs at several competitors. Consequently, there were no issues and pricing was exact. I have faith the furniture will last and be quality, to withstand regular wear and tear, the reason for my repeat business.

This was by far THE WORST EXPERIENCE with an online retailer I have ever had. I am still in shock about the whole ordeal because it was like the Twilight zone. I made the original order for about 70 shirts and was told they would arrive on May 16th. I flew across the country on May 15th and when I landed I had an email from ooshirts telling me there was a problem with my order and I needed to call them immediately. So of course I called them right away. THERE COMPANY DOES NOT ACCEPT PHONE CALLS! The voicemail literally said they can't answer their phones due to high call volumes (RED FLAG). So I emailed them and politely asked them to call or email me back right away. These shirts were a preorder for my online shop and they were bought and paid for by customers. A few days went by and I heard nothing from them. So I started emailing them daily. Not a single response for over 3 weeks. I was in tears multiple times because I felt so powerless. This company had my customer's money and I literally couldn't talk to ANYONE about it. I finally got online and tried their chat for about the 20th time. FINALLY someone responded (it took a minimum of 10 minutes between each chat reply) The guy online said they needed to get my approval to delay the shipping date before they could print. ARE YOU JOKING? You've already missed my deadline and you are saying you've been sitting on my shirts because you have to ask if they can be delayed? I basically told him if they weren't sent to production that day I would file a claim with every available outlet I could. He assured me they would be sent that day. A week later I received another email saying there was a delay. I just broke down crying and immediately called Paypal. Not surprisingly that evening I received an email saying my shirts were being printed and gave me a new delivery date for the following week. The shirts finally arrived almost 3 months after I placed the order. The best part is now a few months later I am getting email responses from the dozens of emails I sent them 5 months ago. All of which are automated letters telling me my order was delivered. Yeah thanks guys. TERRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL....JUST THE WORST OF THE WORST.

"WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!!!! takes a lot for me to complain about service because I've worked in customer service for so many years. So I have the empathy to see both sides of almost any situation. It takes extreme that negligence or rudeness or both to make me complain. This is the first review I've ever done. I'm not sure how well they work for other people but GrubHub in my area has absolutely failed not once,  but twice!!  I'll never even attempt to order using their services again. They have competitors here and those competitors are doing a much better job. the first time we ordered using grubhub because I am working two jobs and wanted to make sure that the kids had a hot meal instead of waiting on me to get home and stand in the kitchen another one to two hours. GrubHub accept the order after listing the restaurants that are still open. The restaurant was listed to be open another hour and half! We received no updates for over an hour. But the estimated time of arrival was 45 minutes to an hour so we didn't think anything of it until we received an email an hour and half later stating that it could not be delivered . The email came with a promo code to take off our next order. Come to find out the driver didn't make it in time. tonight for the same reasons we tried the promo code and GrubHub again. Alas after an hour and a half of waiting we receive another email from GrubHub 7 minutes after the restaurant closed stating yet again they've dropped the ball and the driver did not get there in time. I called customer service to no avail. The person at the other end of the line could not help me at all. again I will never use GrubHub again and I will tell everyone I know not to use GrubHub ever!!! The only reason they got one star from me is because I had to put at least one star in order to post my review!!!! Awful!!

The glasses I received looked drastically different than the glasses I ordered.  I outreached Zenni and they were no help - they advised that color 'could' look different but basically advised I could pay for shipping to return.  Bad customer service.  What 'should' have happened is - they shoudl have advised they were sorry for the experience what can we do to make it better?  The customer should be treated with respect - especially a first time customer with a family of people who wear glasses.  Much lost revenue due to the poor customer service.,0,Zenni Optical,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/481735600000640005026f44/0x0.png,http://www.zennioptical.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I've ordered previously from the now closed Windsor, CT location and was very satisfied. Now that your operation is in TN the experience was awful. This first started on Monday, Oct 21st. After looking at some parts over the prior weekend, I had some questions about which brand to choose and specific parts. It took me three calls to get someone to answer the phone. Is there only one guy answering phones there? Then the guy told me Rein brand was made in Germany which isn't true. I found out its actually made in Turkey from your website. Next was the poor communication and shipping after I ordered 13 items. I REALLY needed some eccentric bolts to finish a job I was working on. It states on your website if you order by 4pm your order will be shipped that same day. I placed my order shortly after Noon in Tuesday, 10/22. I received the first shipping confirmation at 11am the next day for only two of the parts. So I called the TN number to ask if the eccentric bolts ordered would be shipping out soon and if they could give me an ETA on them. Of course, once again no one answers the phone the two times I called so I ended up leaving a message. Miraculously, I got an email at 6pm saying they shipped but no one called me back like I asked. That's what keeps customers coming back and creates business growth. I got the final package shipping confirmation at 8pm that same day. I received the first and thirs packages on Friday 10/25. As far as the most important items, the eccentric bolts, I have still yet to receive. On top of thay, the tracking number still says ""Your package is on its way to a USPS facility"" and its been the same since 10/23 at 9:13pm. It is now 10/26 so I still dont know if the items ever shipped or what's going on. I'd call but that's a waste of time obviously. Apparently they are coming from Texas. Order number is 1905528 if you want to review it. I think I will order from FCP for my two VWs, BMW and Volvo. You guys don't compare when it comes to customer service, even if your prices are great.

I have good experiences in the past but the shipping scenario is no longer acceptable.  I was getting shipments to the house until FedEx started subbing the delivery to homes through the USPS.  ALL rural carriers cannot leave packages at your home if they do not fit in the box or if the security gates are locked.  Please provide an alternative to FedEx as UPS and DHL still deliver to the house and are doing so infallibly. USPS/FedEx just carries the package one time and then I have to make a 20 mile trip to gain my package.  In the last scenario the order was shipped in multiple boxes at different times so the trip was increased two fold.  That makes the cost of goods unacceptable.  Three strikes you're out.,0,Dvor,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/5145e31e0000640005242838/198x149.png,http://www.dvor.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Seemingly, I thought I booked a tee time to play on Friday, 9/12/14.  I went to my email to print out a copy of the confirmation email, when I saw that the tee time was scheduled for the Same Day - 9/10/14.  I immediately called to find out what the deal was.  The customer service agent told me that the system must have re-routed me to the current day, since I needed to book three players, but two players were only available for Friday's round.  I thought, what kind of run around am I getting here.  He was friendly enough and gave me the option to give me a credit and use the money for another round or refund my money.  I opted to get my money back.  From the moment I finished booking the tee time and the time I received the confirmation email couldn't  have been more than a minute.  It wasn't like I waited till the next day to cancel or reschedule, I called immediately because of an error.   And to top things off, it was raining most of the day here in Southern Wisconsin.

The next day i received an email confirming my refund - Green fees less Booking fees.  I called immediately and was told that they couldn't refund my money but give me a four dollar and change credit towards my next round or rounds.  So, let me get this straight, the customer service agent says the ""SYSTEM"" re-routes me but I have to pay the booking fees because of Golf18networks error?

"I tried to buy a deal for an adult scooter, I received an error message when I was making my payment but also received a confirmation from Paypal that the money was sent to Groupon. I called Groupon first to which an advisor informed me the payment was not successful and that Paypal had blocked the payment. I called Paypal who told me that the payment was successful and advised me to call back Groupon with the Invoice ID I was provided with. I called back Groupon and explained the situation to them, this time the advisor said that the order was successful. It all sounded a little fishy to me so I asked for my order to be cancelled to which the advisor said that is fine and that it would take 5-7 working days for my money to be refunded to me. I closed my account with them the following day or the day after as I kept receiving emails stating that my order was being dispatched and that is was on its way. I called Groupon to make sure they hadn't processed my order and explain how my money was supposed to be refunded to me. The advisor told me that you aren't supposed to close your account if you are being refunded and that they will now have to do what is called a manual refund (I take partial fault for this, but the advisor who I contacted to close my account did not tell me I had to wait for the refund before closing my account!). The advisor informed me I was going to have to wait a few days for them to come to a resolution, I completely understood and awaited to hear back from them. I have since received 2 emails from them, one asking me if the problem had been resolved yet (um, no...

"2 experiences with Paypal. Both bad. 1. Claimed replacement of part under warranty. Paypal initially said ""no problem"". I filled out the required online form. That's the last I heard. I didn't bother (I now wish I had) due to the small value item. 2. My Bank account was charged for a purchase I supposedly had made. I knew it wasn't my item because I had not made a purchase for many months (maybe year). I contacted Paypal immediately. Not even an acknowledgement of my message. Great service, I don't think .

"I have never left a review before and so shocked by this company i had to leave a review. So i bought a relatively small item that is 12.75"" round and 1.75"" deep and weighs 2lbs. I sent this item as a test as i need a service like this going forward. They wanted nearly £200 to ship this item to the UK!!! One of the biggest services they pride themselves on is their repacking service. They have listed the box as 18x18x24. Which seems extremely oversized. So i contacted the manufacture and they gave me the dimensions of the product box of 18x18x4 which means it will fit in the box 6 times!! So the repackaging service they apparently offer does not exist or they got the dimensions completely wrong on the box. What it seems to me is, they dress it up, offer a nice site and then charge a fortune on shipping, it's ludicrous and possibly a scam. I am a decent and fair person and contacted support several times, first time Friday and after chasing i get a reply back today being Wednesday which might as well said unlucky the box is what it is, they took a long time to get back and the reply seemed a generic reply. If you use this service, be prepared to right off any goods you send to them as you might find the shipping costs way outweigh the goods you buy. I have bought much bigger and heavier items from USA that have cost me much less to post. Such potential, such a shame. I am disgusted and shocked.

"I placed my order a week ago after seeing great reviews of the Shapermint Highwasted Shaper Panty on Facebook.  I received my confirmation fairly quickly and a shipment confirmation within 24 hours. After searching the internet for reviews I stumbled upon here only to see negative review after negative review. I said to myself okay maybe i made a mistake ordering this product.. So i will just wait and see what happens..  I received my order Today, two days later than promised due to the inclement weather we experienced in the midwest. The packaging was very cute. Coupon offers was enclosed inside. I took the Shaper out the package it was in and the material felt really thin. I tried it on, it did absolutely nothing as described it would do. Only thing it did do successfully was stay in one place, did not fold or roll down. Very disappointed, nothing about this product felt smooth or compressed. Im not too upset with cost because I just so happen to catch it when it was 50% off and I found a coupon code online, so with shipping I barely paid $17 all together. I would of definitely gave 5 stars had the panty did as it said it would, but again the material was very thin and made no difference to my figure.",0,Shapermint,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5bdc1f534c2c1b0001dc2b39/0x0.png,https://shapermint.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"As a longtime customer of Expedia (for several years I was a GOLD member), I was surprised to recently realize that the first time I needed their assistance I was not able to receive it. I used EXPEDIA's service to rent car on April 25th 2019 in Rome, Italy (Itinerary: 7427668957092). The rental company was Dollar (serviced in Rome by Hertz). All went well of my side – I returned the car with even more fuel than what was in the car when I took it. However, I soon discovered that the rental company has charged me 100.83 Euro because I ""neglected"" to fill the fuel tank. On May 8th I sent an email to Expedia with the relevant documents showing that the car was returned with even with more fuel than received (I received – 6/8 fuel tank, I returned 7/8). Meaning that the charges by Rental Company are wrongful. Since this email, Expedia has been dragging their feet in any possible way and finally on  May 31st I got an email explaining that Dollar ""have denied your refund request"" and that EXPEDIA "" act only as an agent"". I am now wondering why should I bother with EXPEDIA services if they are not able to protect and represent you?

They were so difficult to understand, English is not their primary language so I did a conference call with the airlines to help get my flight changed. The agent from United proceeded to tell us both the fare for the ticket I was sold was over $3,000 less expensive than what I paid and this was all business class and it was one week before departure. In other words, I did not get value, I got really over charged. I further found out they buy ""bulk tickets"" so these are not even the same type of tickets as if you went directly to the airline.

"Share my honest opinion, that'll be easy! I ordered a Christmas present on 12/14 and @ checkout I was guaranteed delivery by 12/21. I even jacked up shipping just in case. On 12/20 I emailed customer service (still never answered). 2 hours later I called to explained this gift was for my daughter and it was very important to her and therefore the upmost importance to me! I was told the gift was a little behind but it was going out. 12/21 still no email confirmation so I called again and again I was guaranteed delivery but probably on 12/24. I told the rep now how imported this gift was to my daughter and it really needed to arrive. At this point I offered to pay overnight @ my expense. I was told that was not necessary. Yep, 12/22, you guessed it, I just got the email stating the package would not arrive until after Christmas. Now, you will take this review and compare it to the others but just keep in mind that if a company can ignore this father's need to get his daughter a Christmas gift just image how they will treat you??  This is totally on them! They did not need to lie twice! There was time to refund and give me a fighting chance to not let my child down but that is NOT how they decided to handle me, my daughter, our order. How will they handle yours??  The email I received stating the order would not arrive before Christmas said it would arrive on 12/26, hmmm, i wonder if I should count on it?? I will keep Trustpilot posted. I just went through all the reviews for the last 48 hours and you guys really wrecked a ton of people's Christmas!! Please do not respond to my post saying you are sorry because your NOT!

"I've used their service for many years and it's been useful.  However, any prospective customer should know that shipping is expensive and slow. They also have an incredibly strict set of generic rules covering what they will and won't do - and they won't consider individual cases.  They also seem to apply the rules arbitrarily.  A good example is a paperweight which was made in China and which I had shipped back to HK/China where I live.  This was done without any problem but the third time they refused to ship it to my address for a reason which made absolutely no sense. Another example is a shipment of four bottles, one of which was broken.  It is very complicated to get them to return the shipment to the sender and, as with anything else they do, they charge a high fee for doing this.  They would not destroy the broken bottle and send the other bottles to me on the basis that it would be too dangerous for their packers to do this.  It's not that hard to put on a pair of gloves, pick out the unbroken bottles and then destroy the remaining contents of the package. Again, they have a set of rules and they won't deviate from the rules, regardless of the circumstances.",0,MyUS.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/4916cfc6000064000503df9b/198x149.png,https://www.myus.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Today there was an issue with my card on file (not sure what the issue was, the card had not expired or anything) and I updated my payment info asap with a different card because I did not want to miss the next  Freshly delivery (due next Wednesday, in 4 days). The support was kind and polite but did not solve the problem. Yesterday the status of my order was fine, indicating I would be charged soon. It does not seem fair that everything was okay yesterday and today there is no way to fix the issue. It's disappointing that Freshly can't charge my card again today (4 days before my delivery is due, and the same the issue with the old card was detected), reschedule the delivery so that I can still get food next week or at least offer a solution or credit to make up for this inconvenience.

I also think that they have forgotten to ship it and  cannot trace it them selves.  As for the first two items a tracking number was provided, which I could trace.  NORACORA could not explain this to me, they asked me to wait a while to see if the package would come.  They are saying that they cannot provide the tracking number due to privacy laws, what a JOKE!

Now, owning multiple pairs of this same model, you can tell when they've been worn. I contacted Stockx and their response was the shoe passed their ""authentication"" process. Don't waste your time trying to contact them either, they give you these canned responses that make them sound like their customer service is in a 3rd world country. The only benefit of this website is that the prices are sometimes lower than you'd find on eBay but at this point, that's all they have.

"I shopped at Tobi for the first time after eying some clothes for a while. I bought 3 dresses in the same pattern and same size with different styles. Shipping said 3-5 days, and I knew that a few days would be needed to process, but the package didn't come in for almost 2 weeks. I was fine with that, as I don't need the dresses until New Year's Eve, but when they finally came in they fit horribly. One of them was so small I couldn't get it on, one barely fit and came to mid butt-cheek, and one was very tight in the hips and loose in the chest. I ordered a few new dresses and figured I'd return the others. 5 days ago, I placed the new order... However, it still says ""processing"" and hasn't even shipped. I gave myself well over a month to find a dress for New Year's Eve and it seems like I probably won't even have the second order in time. I'm annoyed with the lengthy shipping process (at least acknowledge a realistic timeline rather than saying 3-5 days) and the fit of the clothes (If I'm buying the size that I always wear, at least one of three should at least somewhat fit).

"My fiance and I booked flights in October 2014 from Sydney to Bali for our honeymoon which we are due to go on on the 16th of March. In January we received an email from Garuda Indonesia and then Bravofly to tell us that our flight had been changed from the 16th of March to the 17th of March. A full 24 hours later meaning we would loose out on an entire days holiday as well as the cost of our hotel for that night. Having spoken to both Garuda and Bravofly we established we were entitled to a FULL REFUND! We went ahead and requested this via Bravofly. We were then informed by Bravofly that a confirmation email would be sent to us once this request had been sent to Garuda. This email never arrived. Being concerned that we would not be able to book replacement flights without this refund I emailed the Bravofly customer service team for an update and was then informed that they could not guarantee when we would receive our refund, they would charge us $20 each handling fee for the privilege and could take up to 12 MONTHS!! to get our money back to us. I have contacted both Bravofly and Garuda several times since this. Neither Garuda or Bravofly can tell me 1. where our money is and 2. when our refund will be processed. Being that our honeymoon is now only 2 weeks away I have managed to find the money to book flights with another airline. However this has now prevented me from paying a supplier for our wedding. So I decided to call the Canberra Bravofly customer service centre today. Firstly, the person who answered the phone (i cannot give you their name as they didn't bother to provide it) answered the phone with ""HELLO"" no more and no less, I proceeded to explain the situation to him, he then huffed and puffed and then told me there was nothing i could do but maybe if i had asked for the voucher this wouldn't of happened. I was never informed that a voucher was an option and was certainly never advised that it would take up to 12 months to receive the refund. I cannot believe that neither Garuda or Bravofly are only able to advise me the refund is pending... The customer service I have received from Bravofly has been disgraceful. Poorly worded, formatted and 1 word sentence replies to emails and telephone calls with customer service reps who couldn't care less about their customers. I would never ever use bravo fly ever again.",0,Bravofly,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/47ff74ec00006400050242a5/0x0.png,https://www.bravofly.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I will not be purchasing from Bookbyte again, as I ordered a math textbook for my 7th grader July 25th and today, August 12th, it is still not here. My son had to start school without his textbook and no one will take responsibility for it. I contacted both Book Byte and the seller that is represented by BookByte and neither one have been able (willing?) to offer any help. (The seller was Fastmedia) Update: The company's response (below) will not help my son who STILL does not have his 7th grade math text book. Repeated attempts along the way were completely fruitless -- I was told to just wait. Zero tracking information. Zero offers to cross-ship another one so that he would have one for the first day of school. Bookbyte has an obligation to stand behind their sellers and hold them accountable for good customer relations. Filling out a report and waiting will do NOTHING to resolve our current situation.

"I purchased my 2011 Hyundai Sonata in August. The moment I drove off the lot the low tire pressure sensor came on. I took it a tire shop that stated that the sensor is going out in one of the tires and also they made me aware that the front passenger side undercarriage has been wrecked. Mind you I signed a letter with Drive Time stating the vehicle has never been in an accident. It makes sense though, my rack & pinion is going out and the vehicle is only at 78k miles. Makes me wonder if the front end was damaged. When I bought the vehicle it was sitting on the side of the building and now I wonder if it even was inspected properly because it was not detailed yet. Now I receive a letter from Hyundai advising me that the vehicle is on the recall list because of a major engine component going out while driving. I can't win from losing with this vehicle. So now i am left to pay a almost $500 car payment, $200 for insurance and also the cost of the rack & pinion which is around $800 or more. I am unhappy with the vehicle and the lack of support from Drive Time. This will be the last car I purchase from them.

"So I rented a book from bookbyte. It took the book 14days to get to my home and rental date was counting down. Anyways, I went to school two weeks without book. Finally when the book came, the professor said he wont need the book. So I post the book through USPS. My tracking was not updated for 7days. So I am guessing the book was lost in transit. When I contact bookbyte about this, they told me that I have to pay the purchased price which is like $163 plus the rental price which was $57. Are these people kidding me? When I asked them if my $57 will be discounted from $163, they said NO. That its my fault. WHAT is wrong with these people?It was not my fault that the book was lost in transit. I believe I should get some type of discount for this because I don't even have the book, So why should I pay a total of $220. I find the buy it now price on Amazon for $90 and they are charging a ridiculous amount for these books. I would not recommend this website to anyone.

So I saved $ not having to invest in the solvent to remove it. I have not experienced color transfer on my clothes or sheets but I could have wiped it away too with as many times as I wipe my face. It does last longer than an average pencil but I don't know if it's worth it for me to reorder when I'm done with mine.",1,Wunder2,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/570f79130000ff00058b8116/198x149.png,http://wunder2.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"The lineup that MotoMummy has is pretty good, but they need to work on keeping the customer in the loop.  It took close to a month for me to get my sprocket and chain kit.  I later found out that they needed to back order my rear sprocket since the one I asked for was not common, which is fine.  What isn't ok is that I saw no attempt to contact me about it; I needed to call in myself after I was charged and saw nothing happening.  No email (and I checked the spam folder), no missed calls.  Again, they've got good stuff, but they need to try harder to talk to their customers. Edit: To respond to MotoMummy, I emailed you on the 31st of August to deal with the order.  The call on the 14th was because I hadn't heard anything from you or received a tracking number since.  You say you sent 2 email notifications, but I received nothing, not even in my spam folder.

Other than that, the flower quality is usually very nice and the blooms last. The company is good about rectifying situations where the flowers die shortly after arrival.

Also another Lp record showed it was brand new sealed. I received it used with no shrink wrap with the two top corners badly crushed! A month later i received an email showing two of the records were back in stock so i thought before i order them i would call customer service to verify that they had them. The guy said they did not have them and seemed really confused. He was not very professional about talking to me or describing anything!

"Let me start off by saying that I love this controller and think that it along with the service I received during the holiday season was wonderful. I won't be talking about their service, just the control today. The Good: - The control feel great! I have fallen in love with the pro grip and the Scuf grip handles and will be sure to put them on all new controllers I use in the future. - When using the trigger stops the power to alter them to the shortest pull needed from game to game is amazing.(with its downsides) They are very easy to install and remove with the tool they provide with the kit. - Lastly but not at all the least, it looks even better in person the website does not do their color choices any services. The Bad: (Not all bad just not my taste) - First off let me say that this isn't so much a bad thing or of a personal taste. Let's start with the trigger stop... I know I said they are great but the biggest issue I have is that you either have to have them on or off which at first probably sounds like I'm dumb right? I bought them so why not use them? Well, when you have them on the controller you can not adjust them to give you free control. You start only being able to press down half way and can only restrict yourself further from there. This alone isn't a big issue but when compared to the Elite sold by Microsoft I believe for a player that play any game where you use both guns and cars the Elite controller would be a better fit for you. - Next the paddles. The Axe paddles themselves are great and easy to use when you're only using the outside paddles that your finger more than likely rest on most of the time as for the inner paddles they can prove fairly difficult to hit for anyone that has shorter finger making them nearly useless if not harder to use. Now for the horrible... When I got my controller it was in perfect condition but after about a two days of use one of the inner paddles broke off. For a controller that I spent 180$ on the plastic used for the paddles is insanely cheap and when looking into found this is pretty common for people. - I love using this controller but I have one huge annoyance that keeps me from honestly enjoying it. The back button and no I don't mean the B button I mean the back button left of the select button can be very unresponsive. I've tested it and it does work but it has to be pressed down all the way sometimes while other only slightly. From what I can tell the button used in my controller is slightly smaller than the select button which means that I have to make sure to press it flat to the controller with each use. In the past, this wouldn't have bothered me but with the rise of my interest in games like PubG and Fornite where the map is commonly linked to that button, it can cause simple gameplay to require me to spam a button just to remove the map to let me see the player shooting at me. On the subject of the buttons, I'd also like you to be informed that due the alterations made to the design to allow you to change your joysticks the frame around the joystick is insanely close to the A button. For a player with larger thumbs be warned you may find it a slight annoyance. All around I'd have to say this controller is worth a good amount of money whether or not you believe it is worth the cost Scuf sells it for would most likely be linked to the amount you invest into gaming. Even with the issue I have had I do not regret my buy even though it didn't live up to the expectation I had and in addition has cause me to take an interest in purchasing an Elite controller to use in games where turning off the trigger stops on the fly would come in handy I still find that it's well worth the money I spent.

"I absolutely love being an Angel and receiving all the great wine that is available to the lucky few.  My gripe is the delivery.  It has been a week since I placed my order and I have not received my case of wine.  I waited home ALL day on Sat., July 11 for the FedEx delivery that was ""in transit"" all day!  After no delivery by 8:00 p.m., I figured that the wine was not going to be delivered.  I called FedEx and was told the delivery would not happen until the week of July 12; probably on Tuesday, July 14.  I just checked my email and, in fact, the wine is again ""in transit"" with delivery scheduled some time today.  The thought of waiting home for a delivery AGAIN is not something I'm looking forward to.  The only thing that makes the wait bearable is the delicious wine that we will enjoy.  If FedEx makes another ""delivery exception"" after waiting for this delivery, I might cancel my Naked Wines membership.

It is nice to have quick case available but I was surprised at the fees that are charged. Each time you access they charge a very high fee. Now that I know this I will probably discontinue using this as a way to access case. The loan fees are already too high and then the access is tacked on top of this. Looked good at first compared to other lenders but this access fee soured my thoughts and it seems like a hidden way to recoup and end up being no better than other lenders.,1,Mobiloans,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5196f432000064000532feb1/0x0.png,http://www.mobiloans.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I think that out off all rideshare services out there lyft does a great job at taking care of the customers and building a community. It has been their goal and they have kept working on that idea non stop. However from the partners point of view there is alot more they can do to take care of their partners(drivers) since they are who move the company forward. There the face of the company and there is just more they can do. Most certainly they are the best rideshare company to be with but only cuz the other one is UBER but every partner know that they are the worse and ther is really no other competitors out ther.,1,Lyft,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/52a2362c000064000577889d/0x0.png,http://www.lyft.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
First my I state that the employees are helpful although I believe the prices are somewhat excessive.  For mount balance and weights I was charged $2.99 per tire for parts and $15.00 per tire for labor. I would estimate that each tire take 5 minutes to mount and balance so that would be 4 tires times $17.99 is $71.96 for twenty minutes of work times 3 equals  $215.00 hour. Then $7.00 per tire for Nitrogen fill which I was unaware of that and could of saved $28.00 by using regular air.,1,American Tire Depot,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/590399010000ff0005a16a60/0x0.png,http://www.americantiredepot.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Teleflora has the most beautiful floral designs of any of the ""top"" brands for flower delivery (FTD, 1800flowers, etc). When I started using them (3-4 years ago), I was so happy with the service & quality, as compared to other brands--even if they were a bit pricey. However, my last 3-4 experiences have not been so good: late deliveries; dying/wilted flowers; not the promised container/design. My last delivery was for my mom. Flowers were beautiful & vibrant--but I ordered a particular arrangement for the beautiful mercury glass vase it advertised & I didn't get it. The vase it came with was a very basic plastic cylinder with ""metal-like"" plastic coating. It was downright ugly and detracted from the flowers. I know it says that they sometimes substitute, but I haven't gotten the promised container the last 4 times I've ordered. The worst part was that half of the flowers were dead the next day. That was an $80+ arrangement. I've also taken the time to write to Teleflora to tell them of my disappointment; I've never received a response.

"I’m pleased with my refrigerator but it took about 10 days longer to get it than we planned. The shipping company that was used here in Dallas, Texas was impossible to deal with. The female we talked with was unhelpful, rude, condescending, disrespectful and uncaring about our situation. She did not care that it was in Dallas sitting and waiting to be delivered as we had planned 9-10 days before. We had to wait until she said it was going to be delivered. We paid for a Gold Plan delivery that would put the refrigerator in the kitchen. I was told I could attach it to the wall. She said I would have to pay an extra  $100. dollars to have the the box removed, more to connect to water line, buy a water line if I didn’t have one. So it was over $200.00. This is a racket!!!  I said NO just deliver .   I called the day of delivery and she said it was scheduled between 9-1 and  I would be their last delivery.  So I was thinking of going ti the store, until I saw a truck. They were at my neighbors. Then they called and asked if I was at home and they had a delivery for my neighbors house. The girl running the delivery office had on purpose told me it was going to be around 1:00 pm until I received my delivery hoping I would leave and miss my delivery and have to reschedule. She told the delivery guys the wrong address my next door neighbors so I would not get my delivery.  I told the delivery guys the story and they were suppose to report her.  But he said I understand that you asked about us setting up and taking the box. I told him I did but this same girl told me you could not do it because you didn’t have any tools. He said he has tools and stated he could do the water line placement for 25.00 but would have to charge me &100.00 to take the box. I did it but I truly think all of these people are in on it. Its a scam and I got played. I feel stupid because I gave them each a tip for their help. The main guy had me write the check out to him and took both of the tips. He said he would split the check and the cash with the other guy. I doubt it! Lesson learned!!!

"I booked the rental over the phone. The customer service rep was very helpful and courteous.  She advised that Avis and Alamo were the only car rental companies that had rental counters inside this particular airport. She informed me that the best deal was through Alamo so she booked it. When we received the e:mail confirmation it stated that it was booked with.  I thought that perhaps she mistakenly told me Alamo over the phone when it was actually Avis.  The problem arose when we got to the airport and found there were no car rental counters in the airport, that they are all in a remote location.  We got up to the Avis counter after waiting in line for about 40 minutes.  They informed us that they didn't have a reservation for us and the paperwork indicating the reservation number was not one of theirs, though it stated Avis in the text.  We told them of initially being informed it was being booked with Alamo so they suggested we go to their rental counter. So we dragged our luggage over to Alamo and, thank God, they did validate that our reservation was with them.

"Buses were old and had seen better days. The tours largely depend on who your tour guide is. Our first tour guide was the highlight of the experience and there was a sharp decline after that. They were all very nice enough to inform you of where they are going and if it is consistent with your plan for the day. It's convenient because they do have a bus that literally goes to any tourist attraction in the city. However, we got stuck on one for much longer than we anticipated and we suffered, freezing cold for 1.5 hours while trying to get to the place we wanted to go.

"I really want to like Park and Fly, the people and service there are fantastic.  But I can't get over the fees that are tacked on that most people probably don't pay attention to (and don't they know it...). Worst is the gas surcharge.  Somehow 2 years after the high gas prices went away and during a period of historically low gas prices they are still charging a gas surcharge.  It blows the mind and is inexcusable especially for a company that works so hard to project such a great image. Then you have the Access Fee.  Why is this a separate fee instead of a cost of doing business built into the prices?  It is like Amazon charging you an extra 10% for warehousing the stuff before they ship it. Finally the $4 processing fee, which is the fee for the national company to place my reservation on the website.  Because somehow processing my reservation is not a normal part of the business???  This is like Amazon charging me to take my order... The $18+ combination of the three, especially the gas surcharge, is beyond sketchy and makes a mockery of their posted prices.

"Order #16162516 Product description: Hole's Human Anatomy and Physiology Practice with Connect Plus/LearnSmart 2 Semester Access/APR Online/PhILS Online I purchased this book used online. While I understand that used materials may not include all access codes and separate materials, the description actually says it comes with it. I added this book to my cart prior to the new year, and sold a buyback. I waited until my account was credited to buy the book in the cart. However, the price went up on it. But I went ahead and purchased it anyway and assumed that the price increase was due to the code being included with the book. It was not.  when I called to find out why, I did not receive any sincere resolution. I am now without the code and have paid more for this book than it was worth a month ago. I will not be buying from the site anymore, I felt that the description was misleading and no one really cared that I felt scammed.

"I have had a very good experience selling books to this company except for one issue: when you put in the name of a book, or even the ISBN, several options come back, which makes it very confusing. I had a book that showed me an option with the exact same picture as my book and offered a decent price for it, so I sent it. They didn't pay me for it because my book didn't have an ISBN (older edition, I guess), but looked just like the picture. When I asked what happened to the book, they said they could not return it and referred me to their Terms & Conditions. Well, really, does anybody read all that? I just wish they had made it clear that, even if a book looks identical, they can't buy it back without an ISBN. I would have never sent that book if it had been made clear.

Two of the three needed to be reordered -- one had bubbles in it and the other had a large white speck in the crystal and it was not a scratch.  It also had some bubbles.  For the two years I've ordered the awards, the presentation boxes they came in were so obviously damaged yet the packaging box was not.  Last year I had to have boxes sent several times.  This year two of the three were severely damaged and should have never made it out of there.  I see from reviews that others also experienced this.  I'm waiting for the new crystals and boxes.

"If given the option, I would probably score my trip 2.5.  We were the first pick up stop that morning (May 29), so sitting through all the other stops was no fun (although I didn't deduct for that).  The morning seemed very scattered.  We drove around for an hour (including going back to the office to pick up audios) before we even started the trip to Yosemite.    To be honest, I though he was a little rude to a couple of the other passengers. The bus itself was terrible.  I'm not sure it had shocks at all (and I'm not even a comfortable ride snob), extremely bumpy. Yosemite itself, was of course, gorgeous, which earned probably 2 of the stars. I thought the driver drove too fast down the curvy, mountainous road on the way back and followed cars too closely from behind.  I know that he's probably very familiar with the road, but they way the drove those curves on a bus made me very nervous. The speaker was SO loud, and on the way back, he played music, which was even louder.  Everyone was tired after a long day, soft music, or even silence would have been preferred.

After a long wait and couple of weeks talking to the support I received my skins. Their withdraw system is still a bit buggy because I had to press the claim button a couple of times before the skin arrived via a trade on steam. So if you get an error about bot1 just go back to your inventory on skinhub and try again. As for skinhub as a gambling site : The site looks good and with the now more or less working withdraw system it's promising. BUT the cases are still VERY UNBALANCED which means that you most likely make a huge loss. Don't get me wrong : This is gambling and you'll loose and win sometimes but on this site you really get hit hard if you don't win. Some cases cost around 50€ and you have a 50% or more chance to get a 4€ skin Imao.

"After placing my reviews, the company immediately contacted me. The representative investigated and a refund was issued for the second tub.  I was told a refund has been processed for the first as well. Shady, shady company. Do not use!! Back in Dec I ordered a tub from efaucets. Unfortunately it came via UPS (which they swear they never do but my driver delivered it) damaged but unfortunately my contractor didn't report it until the 33rd day after delivery. As it could no longer be returned another tub was purchased from efaucets. Unfortunately that tub too came damaged. This time I contacted the company THAT DAY for a refund. After an exchange of emails and pictures they told me my refund would be processed. Almost two months went by and I inquired about the refund. I was told I now had to fill out a form. I sent in the form. Hear nothing and inquired again. I received this response: I am so sorry for the delay. There must have been a mix up in communications. We had not put a refund in process at this point. We have exceeded the eFaucet 30day return allowance. The good news is that Kohler is awesome to work with & will still credit you for the damaged tub. The thing is... Kohler asks that you, the customer, to contact them directly for an Authorization of Credit letter. Kohler is super easy to work with & can usually email the letter to you. You can reach Kohler at 1-800-456-4537. Once we have received this letter, we can process the credit back to you. Please feel free to call eFaucets if you have any questions. In case this email does not fully answer your question, or you would like to contact us for any reason, simply reply to this email. You can also get immediate assistance during our normal business hours via our Live Chat support service by clicking the link below: Here's my response: No there was no miscommunication and no we did not exceed the 30 days because I notified you THE DAY it was delivered. I did my due diligence, your company did not. I was told that as soon as picture were received (which they were sent the next day) the refund would be processed. Then OVER 30 DAYS later - only after I inquired about the refund YOUR COMPANY sent me a form!!! YOUR COMPANY SURPASSED THE 30 DAYS PURPOSELY IN ORDER TO PASS THE BUCK TO KOHLER.

"I had two different experiences on my trip to and from DC to NYC.  On the way there, the driver took us on a very strange route.  Maybe it was to avoid traffic but it still seemed too long.  Also, the driver pulled the bus over at the Woodrow Wilson Travel Plaza to wait about 20 minutes for someone who had missed the bus at the scheduled stop in NJ.  On the way back, I called to see if the bus was leaving right on time because I was barely going to make the scheduled departure.  While the phone rep could not help with asking the bus to wait, he did call to check on me and confirm that I had made it.  That's excellent customer service.

The process started great no problems. Then when it was time to automatic withdraw the payment is when the nighmare started.  They didn't send up the correct ARC paper to start with which resulted in us being behind. From day one. ok got the paper withdraws are great for a few days. Then they start hitting us $10.00 here then $25.00 there for the missed payments from them not getting us the correct ARC papers. Next we get emails stating they couldn't auto draft again and another $35.00 extra. They kept posting our we had insuffient funds for the withdraw. Which is not true. We keep 3 weeks of payments in that account just for them so this doesn't happen. We have to call daily. They say oh yes we got it fixed. OH yes it's all good. Not it's not we still get charged the extra $35.00 for no reason. Now if we were at fault I have not problem with the extra fees but not like this. For a lending rate of over 18% for a loan and to be $35.00 every day that loan is really starting to not be worth it. I know should have went with another  lender. Only advice here is to make sure all the papers are in line and check around for the interest rate.,1,OnDeck,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/533895d80000640005787b34/0x0.png,https://www.ondeck.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"Contrary to other reviewers I was quite disappointed about the NY pass. At most attractions you need to get in a line to exchange for a ticket and then enter the line for the attraction, which were extremely long maybe due to the Christmas holidays. Why cannot the pass serve as your entrance ticket like for the ESB? Fast lanes were not there or only when getting near to the ticket counter. Visiting an attraction at the end of the day makes that the day counts for a whole day. So in the end we did not manage to visit sufficient attractions to balance the price we paid for the NY pass.

We had an issue as the airline had changed their flight so that we would now have a 15 hour layover. We obviously didn't want this and Justfly.com was going to charge us to change the flight even though the airline themselves said there would be no charge for a change as it as the airline who was making the original change. I had to go through a couple of supervisors before I finally got someone who spoke English well enough to understand the situation and get it fixed without any charge to me.,1,JustFly,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/54dfeb180000ff00057d6ca6/198x149.png,http://justfly.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I am frustrated that I have to spend my only day off for 6 days at a mechanic and the warranty people said they may not even cover it.  If that happens that car is getting returned. Also they added the extra features to my cost without advising me of doing so.

A really like the location and the shuttle service is timely. The app is good also. The only issue I have is a few of the drivers seem really put out to help you with your bags. If that's not part of the service I should go back to parking at the airport and save 2 bucks a day.Two of the drivers a good. Some of them sit there and look at you. Seems like a pretty easy fix for the management of Pit Stop.

"My overall experience with western union has been good, but I am going with an average rating as I am starting to feel a lot of inconvenience lately while using western union as a money sending service. I have been asked to submit a lot of identification documents every time I am trying to send money someone. The entire process is taking about two to three days before my money is released. I moved from Xoom to WU because of no fees policy that WU has at that time compared to high service fee of Xoom. This has changed recently at WU and I am being charged from $2.99 and more just as I was being charged at Xoom depending on the amount I am sending. These are some of the reasons for 3 start rating and this is causing me to look at other services who are transferring money at a very less or no fees. As soon as I find a good service I will no longer be using WU.

Also, I used to feel somewhat good about using discount codes that support people like Joey Diaz, but the discount from ""subscribing"" and then immediately unsubscribing is more, which also is less gratifying.",1,Onnit,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4e55d4cb000064000510d9f8/198x149.png,https://www.onnit.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I ordered my stuff on a Thursday at  3:45 pm, got my stuff the following Monday at around 3 pm. Their website shows a map of the US and I fell into the area with an estimated delivery length of 1 to 2 business days.. So that wasn't real bad. The stupid thing about them, is that they do not do returns. Even if the product is unopened and has not been used. The only time that they will do a ""return"", is if you have a product that is defective or broken, and even then- it's just an exchange for the same product, and you have to let them know that you have a broken or defective item within 72 hours of receiving your order. Then after that, you have to get the item BACK TO THEM within 7 days. So if you live far away from where they are located, you're probably out of luck no matter what.. They tell you that when you get your package, to immediately open everything up and try everything to make sure that everything is intact and that it all works..There are definitely other sites that will accept returns, as long as the item has not been used and is unopened.. That's pretty much the only thing that I can complain about...

Had problem with booking first reservation through third party (carrentals.com). Required a refund and rebook new reservation (instead of simple change of date). Took 6 weeks to get physical check for refund. Required multiple hours on the phone talking to people both locally and in national office. Sent over 10 emails. Provided all info requested multiple times. Was really hoping for Kia Sodona as advertised. All vans are basic Dodge Grand Caravan. Required $200 ‘deposit’ charge at time of rental. This was an unknown. It’s not a hold but an actual charge that then takes 5-7 days to refund after returning vehicle. Do yourself a favor and ONLY BOOK DIRECTLY.

"I ordered the Fast 5+ program and four weeks of program food.   When I received the shipment, I looked through the written materials before starting the program.  Unless I overlooked it, nothing was said about not exercising during the first week when I was on the Fast 5+ program.   I followed the Fast 5+ plan exactly, without cheating, and also added more activity than I had previously been doing.   At the end of seven days, I had not lost any weight.

"I ordered a set of silk pajamas earlier this month and when they came in I decided I would like to exchange them out for a different Style. At LikySilk you have to email them to get an RMA number, wait for their response and then you can fill out the form and ship them back. This process took several days to complete. You also have to pay for return shipping. Overall the product seemed to be of good quality, and I called with a question about my order and the customer service representative couldn't have been more helpful. If they could simplify the return/exchange process they would have 5 stars.",1,LilySilk,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/502e05c7000064000519a9ee/0x0.png,https://www.lilysilk.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"They proceed my buyback quickly. But I believe they misquoted for one of the books that I sold (They claimed that they received a different book than the one I mailed). I don't think they did this purposely because that book is very cheap. But what I want to complain about is their customer service. I reported this issue to their customer service, but the guy was very unhelpful. He just repeated saying that ""The book we received is XXX but not XXX"" (come on, I already known this from the e-mail!! I'm asking you to double check and show me the proof). I requested to see their check-in details and photo showing my package. But that guy just ignored my request!! I finally gave up communicating with him because I don't want to waste my time.

When I checked the website to see the status, the order had not yet been processed, this was the next week. I called and was told by the representative she was unsure why it was not processed as the product was in stock. She put me on hold and checked with the pharmacist to make sure they had the script, which they did. She told me it would ship out the next day. Well I chec the site tonight to see if I could track the package- nope, but here's the big issue, I orderes 10 bags and only 3 were shipped. No communication from anyone.

When I received the items one of the shirts was defective so I returned it for a refund. And that process was very simple and easy. I then went to re-purchase the shirt and saw that shipping was being applied. I used the talk with an customer service agent now on the computer and explained that I don't feel I should have to pay shipping since I was sent a defective item and am only re-ordering since I was sent a bad product. The customer service only quoted policy that free shipping is only allow after a certain dollar amount has been reached. I explained that this is a special situation and that it was Groupon's fault not mine that I was sent a defective shirt. I understand policies but I also understand loyalty and it Groupon wants to keep customers loyal they need to take care of them. In the end, I ended up purchasing extra items that I did not want to make the total over the amount so free shipping would apply. All they had to do was take off the $3.99 shipping and they could have kept a customer.

When you ship to a business you have to go to post office to pick it up and it has set there All Weekend!  Terrible!

"The experience went Okay.  Post people will only deal with the company once or very infrequently so every customer is going to be a new user.  A couple points worth mentioning.  Its cool for the price you're offering to go up to incentivize a potential customer, but having it go down after they engage with you leaves a bad taste in their mouth.  I clicked on the e-mail that offered $680, and by the time it was all said and done with the web site the offer was $595.  Site insisted I had a Matrix XR based on the VIN but I know the car has always been the base vehicle.  Site seemed to use the claim that it was the higher XR trim level to justify reducing the offer?!?!? Second thing is don't surprise your customers with a stack of blank DMV forms that you expect them to just sign.  You should never sign something you haven't read and understand and your tow operator doesn't want to sit around while I educate myself from the DMV web site.  People are naturally cautious when they've never done business with your company, and this almost blew the deal.  Any forms you want people to sign should be briefed ahead of time to the customer and the form should arrive filled in, not blank.  One of the forms for example was an application for a duplicate title, which made no sense because I had the title in hand.

Really kinda poor becauae they refuse to give my hubsnad the title to the car the are selling to him. And are expceting him to get a tag on the car within 30days. To make it clear the tag place wont even touch a tag for his new car till we get the title my husband had called 2 times and went up there 2 times and his been denied a title. The tag place told us that we could put our jeep tag on there as long as we have the registration to the tag but we dont becuSe jd byrider took it and needed it. If jd byrider is good car dealer then they offer us to keep our reg for the tag and also would have given us the title. Me and my husband will be coming up tjere tomorrow and if we dont get the title in hand to go get tag there will be somone anger in the air that is final. A car lot is suppose to have the dam title and if we dont get it i might be coming back with the police and lawyer. So to me jd byrider is poorlu done on their dam job.,1,J.D.

"There are positives with how quickly the order was done and shipped out. I’d say that is the best part of the experience. However, the quality of the print and execution is where I’d say there is room for improvement. The shirt itself is marked by the press. Like when you hold an iron down too long on a dark shirt. The color of the print isn’t quite accurate to the color I provided which ultimately dialed down the vibrancy of the original color of my design. My last concern is longevity. The transfer or ink on the shirt doesn’t look like it’ll really hold up for that long. Perhaps, some of the fault is on my side. Not specifying a Pantone color and proper file like a vector Ai or EPS, might’ve helped with color accuracy. Also, maybe a phone call to discuss the printing method as well as provide an example of the quality of shirt and print style I’d like would have help hit the target expectation. All that said, it is great for a test run on an original design. The price point is nice and they rocked the shipping. I would definitely like to come back for more.

"There are some interesting products here.  But the fact that there is no review of the products, all (or most) sales final, very little information on warranties (especially for high end watches), very little in ease for customer feedback to Touch of Modern, very little feedback to the customer in the process of waiting for a product, and no ability for customers to give feedback on a product (I realize the sales are temporary and no shipments go out until the sale is over, which is sketchy in and of itself) and very little or no information on who is actually fulfilling the product...just a lot of sketchiness that makes it hard to trust a purchase and I feel there seems to be no information on what happens if a product is faulty.  For instance watch sales say all sales final, no refunds, no warranty info.

I like shopping with your company but you need to make more XLs in your clothing selections. They go faster than any other size. After awhile it becomes frustrating because you have to hurry up and pay for your items the same day when you put them in your bag because tomorrow it might sell out. If your a size small to large you do have to worry because it’s always available. I think you should start making people that wear a XL feel more secure knowing their size will always be available too. Everybody is not a size 2-10. Size 13/ XL is very popular also. But it seems like that size is overlooked because a lot of items are SOLD OUT in less than 24hours. I get emails about new items & try to order it just to find out XL is crossed out.

Vehicle performed well and was reasonably easy to pick up.  Didn't like having to pay a $200 deposit up front which I have since learned results from the facility being off the airport property.  Rental companies on airport property only pay deposit of 20% of the rental cost. The real rub is that I filled the vehicle completely with fuel and drove 15 miles to the return.  Agent twisted her head this way and that and tried to show me how it wasn't really full and charged me another $13.  I'll be contacting Expedia to let them know of my dissatisfaction with the company they recommended to me.,1,Airport Van Rental,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/57a202650000ff0005931059/0x0.png,https://www.airportvanrental.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

It didn't mention the funds were in US dollars, so after the purchase went through, it finally stated USD by the completed purchase.  A rookie mistake by me, and I should've looked closer.  The flight cost me about $100 more than I thought it would (from $266 quote, to $366 on my Visa).  Be aware, and smarter than me.

"For the most part my experience with Tilebar's staff was good. They were friendly and helpful from the point of shipping samples and up to placing an order. However communication has potential to be exhausting if a problem arises.  I absolutely love the 4x8 Calacatta Polished Marble tile I ordered. I ordered 150 tiles; it was a small order,17 tiles were defective and poorly packaged in their original carton. I received two plus units of damaged or poorly polished tiles, and TileBar Reps requested I take photos proving their condition. I was annoyed, some of the imperfections were not easily detected with a basic camera and I'm not a photographer. The Marble tiles were not separated one from the other, some had internal cracks and/or divots front and center. Replace them, don't put the customer through the 5th degree. After a couple of emails and several calls, each time reaching a different Rep, I found myself having to reiterate my concern over and over again. They finally figured out I wasn't requesting to return the entire order, which they were informed of during my second call to them. In that call, I requested only for the defective tiles to be replaced. After several calls one Rep figured out I just wanted the defective tiles replaced; eventually they made good on the order, and replaced the bad tiles. I would have given them 5 stars, however having to constantly reiterate yourself can be exhausting; they finally got it, my concern was fully addressed and resolved.",1,TileBar,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/53f628ee000064000579da53/198x149.png,http://tilebar.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"No issues with the ride to NYC at all. However, encountered a problem on the way back to Columbia, MD.  The bus was supposed to be leaving from Madison Avenue between 26th & 27th Street.  However, when you clicked directions, the address 44 E. 27th Street popped up.  There was a dark green bus with HAYMARKET written on it parked on Madison Ave.  We passed it 3 times, and finally on the 4th pass - with 3 minutes to go, saw a small sign in the front window with ""Our bus"" on it. A larger sign should have been posted on the side windows as well as the back.  We almost missed our bus because of that, and might I add, I was born & raised in NY and know the area well.

Overall trip was great with mostly good experience.  In the end this trip did not save more than using our traditional travel agent.  I think the way to get most value out of vacation express is took book last minute if your schedule is amenable.  Our trip was also aligned with Nexus travel for booking excursions.  Nexus was below average in our opinion.  We have been to Cnacun many times and had a good idea about the excursions we wanted to take. They kept trying to steer us to different excursions which was strange.

"Good quality equipment but for $48 a month CAD for the basic package it’s a little over priced. Especially when the phone agent tells you it will be $35 but doesn’t mention that’s USD.

"I think this is an excellent resource with many options to improve one's own yoga practice and articles of interest. However, for me personally, I just do not have the time to make use of it to the degree that justifies the monthly subscription cost. E.g. I have read approximately since I joined (not because of lack of interest but lack of time). Whilst I realize there is a huge database of knowledge that can be tapped into, I have not had the time to do this. I would give it 5 star if somehow your useage could be tracked and monthly cost could be linked to this. To be fair, I did think this would be a problem for me.

"My wife booked a ticket with Quatar through Vayama. We need to change her ticket to another date, and previously information was given that this comes to xxx amount. $100 penalty from Vayama itself is a rip-off, but anyways, they are upfront about that. Now, for some reason they cannot make the change. the customer care is so incompetent that after speaking to 2 different individuals, none has been able to explain me why I cannot change the ticket to another date. Their employees' English was very poor and hardly intelligible, the background is very noisy,  and they seem to have no interest to be kind or even attempt to explain me the situation. The second person just hung up on me. I will not book again with this company. Seems there is hardly any training or monitoring of customer care staff! Very Indian (I love India, but not that part of it), but come on guys, you are an international company, get with it. The two stars is because Vayama does have good prices once in a while.

"I booked my trip with Property ID #99971 almost a year ago and had Hans Kraeger randomly cancel my family's trip without explanation on 1/27. I proceeded to inquire as to why they following day because he gave no explanation. He said, again, 11 months after I booked, that his policy was to book Saturday to Saturday. I told him ""HomeAway's site allowed me to book the trip and this error is of no fault of my own. I think it would have been courteous, at the very least, to email me prior to just cancelling my family's trip. Perhaps ask if I could change my dates to a Saturday/Saturday or work with me in some fashion. I am also a HomeAway owner and would never cancel one of my guests' vacations without discussing it."" I had to scramble to book another trip, and had to pay more money for lesser value of a property bc there are less options now, 11 months later, as it's much closer to the date our scheduled trip. Refund was processed, but it took 8 days for the money to return to my credit card and I had to pay out of pocket for my 2nd trip with a different VRBO owner as I waited for the money to return to my account. I contacted CS and they ""escalated"" the situation and said I would get an email. I got an email the following day basically stating me and the home owner needed to sort it out. Bottom line is I just don't appreciate that a trip I paid for and counted on that reservation can be cancelled on a whim and no one is accountable for it. If this happened with my Homeaway Property I would have left the reservation be, despite a ""Saturday/Saturday"" policy because that's just the right thing to do for your vacationers.",1,HomeAway,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4a59524f0000640005045a9f/198x149.png,http://www.homeaway.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I tried this for the first time and got a discounted rate. I enjoyed the meals once prepared but it stops there. To begin with the website told me there was an error on the page when I went to make my selections and I had to contact customer support through chat. It was clear they were chatting with several other people simultaneously because the short conversation took longer than necessary. I just wanted to know how to choose my meals. The recipes are really written for an expert because I was supposed to prepare and cook a couple of things while something else was either cooking or preparing. Some of the steps were a bit vague. The recipe list is frustrating when it lists an item and says 1 or 2 (1 or 2 what? oz. grams. tsp. tbsp?) You have to read through the recipe to figure it out. Plus a few ingredients are sometimes not included. And the most important for me was I couldn't find anything on the site that let me simply pick healthy meals based on my macros. I had to guesstimate ingredient by ingredient to know how much carbs, fat and protein I was getting in each meal. The nutrition card provided was a bit off after I calculated everything ingredient by ingredient. I would recommend this to someone who just wants a meal kit and end up with a tasty meal.

I would hate for it to have tons of bubbles and be messed up because I didn't have the tool. I suggest you get one when ordering and it would be nice if they had it come up as a option to buy when you order a sticker. I know they have them available but no where did I see one when ordering.

"I give an average rating because... Speed is relative.  It is good most of the time, but cannot always be counted on.  I have not run out of data, but videos buffer.

Look, I understand that companies can have customer service call centers in other countries, and that it is cheaper.  I also understand that the people in those call centers have been trained to say certain things, but that is not good enough.  Customer service should be about the customer, not about your cost.  These people need to be trained better so that they understand the difference between ""Why is this happening?"" and ""What is happening.""

"I have been a longtime Tobi customer and love the clothes on the site. Back during the holidays I experienced some issues with processing and shipping times but it seems that those are starting to get handled better again. My issues lies with the ""sizing chart/guide"" on the site... a few years ago I was a regular online shopper & a tiny size zero and had no issues ordering smalls. Now, I am a size 4. The site lists sizes 2-4 as a small. I order smalls and they're just small enough that I can't seem to get them zipped or buttoned all the way. I go up to a medium (Tobi lists as sizes 6-8)... WAY too big. I understand that you cannot help how clothes fit, however, you should at least be honest in your sizing charts to more accurately fit the everyday customer - not everyone is a wispy size zero like your models & it sucks having to send things back.",1,Tobi,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/46d6c4a2000064000500e282/198x149.png,http://www.tobi.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I rented a BMW 4 series from Turo and the service went mostly great. First, I found a 4 series that I wanted and the owner emailed me immediately telling me it wasn't actually available when I wanted it. Seems odd that their system wouldn't automatically know that to begin with. She then tried to get me to rent one of her other cars but I wasn't interested in them. But to get to the point of talking to her I had to ""reserve"" and put my credit card in. They really should not list cars that aren't available on the dates you choose. Then I found another that said it had free delivery. So I was stoked. Then I talked to the guy and he said he couldn't actually deliver it. It was the only other 4 series I could find with my specifications so I agreed to it anyway. I don't understand how you can list that but then not provide it. When I got to the Turo lot to pick up the car by LAX, the night shift guy looked incredibly bored and didn't say much the whole time while he was doing whatever he was doing on his phone to sign me in. The car itself was great and I think the price was reasonable.

In addition, there was a miscommunication about our parking validation policy.  This policy has changed this year and we no longer validate tickets, which I communicated to our event planner.  Unfortunately this information did not reach the therapists, and they were a bit taken aback after learning that they were responsible for covering the parking costs.

"I needed a rental car at the last minute - and attempted to make a reservation using the Enterprise App - but, was unable to do so and instead called the rental location. Danny noted that cars are available and to come on in....when I arrived, Danny was the only person in the office and a couple were taking too long with their reservation...causing me to wait a little too long (definitely not his fault). My rental process was fine.....until my vehicle arrived (driven by someone else) and it was completely wet (had been taken through the car wash). While I appreciated a newly washed vehicle - I would have rated the service a 5 if I didn't have to ask the vehicle to be dried.......of which someone else dried off parts of the vehicle but not the major sections (i.e., windows).

"The serviceman ""joe"" was excellent, but took over two weeks to get an appt. apparently there is a major shortage of people to repair your concerns with the system. I feel this is unacceptable for an alarm company to make you wait that long for system troubles, especially when that system operates your climate control ! I had ordered an emergency pendent for an elderly family member that recently moved in with us, salesmen told us at the time of sale, that all we had to do is call and we would receive one for free, not true, so I ended up ordering one, after 10 days  no pendant, so  I called and was told the order self cancelled ?  Vivint customer service said since we had an appt scheduled, they would send one out for free with the service tech, not true.  In the  interim, one showed up in the mail and my credit card was charged $60. I've always had an overall pleasant experience with the customer service folks, but seem to get less than the truth.  I don't expect something for nothing, but when I'm told there won't be a charge for something, don't turn around and charge me !

"Update 7/1/19 - Safestreets came back out and replaced my motion detector with a number of window units.  Apparently I misunderstood that one device couldn't monitor a larger double window area, so my count was off.  I ended up having to buy another $300 in window sensors to get my house secure.  That $300 plus the $360 spend the first time puts me near $700 to get my home secure.  This was after hearing on the phone that all my investment would be was $49/mo for 3yrs; $68/mo with Ring.  My home is secure now, but it cost me a lot more than I had been told up front.  It's over.  It's done.  I want to move past this experience.  $700 paid for peace of mind and to stop misunderstandings/miscommunications.  I recommend SafeStreets be more transparent over the phone.  The ""national standard package"" will not secure a home.  It doesn't come close.  It may guard against intrusion via certain methods or a few areas of your home, but your home will not be completely secure.  That'll cost you....which I found out the hard way. I felt very pressured to buy a system from the tech that came over.  He handed me a sob story about coming all the way from out of town to install my system when i was under the impression that it was merely a planning/fact-finding visit.

"first, the product arrived very late, was told a different story on each inquiry. It arrived just in time for a massive snow storm, delaying installation and extending my lack of phone service as my first booster died of old age (approximately 18 months).  Then, after designing a tower to get the antennas the minimum 20 feet apart vertically, I find out you need a lightning suppressor AND a surge protector (1000 joules minimum or your warranty is voided) Now that added another long trip to town. Knowing their customers are rural (or we would not need a booster) Wilson FAILS to include either of these items. Unforgivable.  Charge more if need be but include EVERYTHING I need in the box, dammit.....finally, WHY is the coaxial cable bright white? Again I am rural and a bright white cable looks like hell on my house, so now I have to paint it to disguise it.   OR look like a booster commercial. This is NOT a well thought out device in many ways. The installation instructions leave a little to be desired also.  I will be looking elsewhere bor my next booster, rest assured.

I am tired of adding so much eyebrow pencil to my eyebrows early every morning just to see they don't match, at all and it looks drawn on. This product, if you know how to do makeup well can be useful. It stays on for a couple of days if you are careful while washing your face. They still look drawn on, but I like that they stay on for awhile. Also I use a taupe color pencil and wasn't sure which color to buy - I bought blonde though I'm a brunette with blonde lowlights. You need to keep adding the product so my husband who tells me like it is notices, even using blonde, my eyebrows sometimes come out way too dark. It's not a very thick substance, more watery so you keep adding color to fill in where needed. Maybe they should make it a little thicker so if you buy blonde, it looks blonde or at least taupe.

What I really wanted was a pair of slides so I didn't waste any time I got home and ordered a pair  of the slides since the store didn't have any.

I believe the roof is leaking so it would be great if they were to fix that problem, otherwise I guess I will be moving my things out in the near future to another storage facility.

"The recipes pretty much always look good, but we've had some issues. First, the biggest issue - our produce arrives partially frozen, crushed, or rotten 75% of the time. Definitely doesn't invoke the descriptor, ""fresh."" Second, our meals are really good only 20% of the time. The rest of the time, they are either too greasy, relatively tasteless, or devoid of green vegetables. We alternate with Blue Apron and choose Hello Fresh more often because the recipes sound more appealing. But the Blue Apron meals always feel higher quality and tend to be tastier. I'd say Blue Apron Meals are really good 50% of the time. Moreover, the Blue Apron communication is way better. Our Hello Fresh boxes were held up in the mail several weeks in a row due to weather and maybe some other issues, and Hello Fresh didn't contact us at all. Even when one of our boxes was 6 days late! Blue apron is always on top of that. Overall, it's been nice to not have to plan my own meals, but the Hello Fresh experience has been just okay.",1,HelloFresh US,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/50feb403000064000521268c/0x0.png,http://www.hellofresh.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Overall Cupshe offers cute and affordable gear. The quality is similar to a h&m or forever21 store, but with cheaper pricing. I've received great service from Cupshe whenever I needed to inquire about something. The biggest downside to ordering here is the 5-9 week wait to receive your shipment (that's going standard without any expedited shipping option selected). Also, you cannot make returns simply because someone doesn't fit, so if you're wavering on a size I say just order up. Items have been more likely slightly small than large based on my past orders.",1,Cupshe,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/55e2670c0000ff000582bafb/0x0.png,http://www.cupshe.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"I ordered my Anglican Organist robe reading the size instructions and ordered an EH: I'm 5'6, 135 lbs and chest measures 37 "". I put it on and the robe was too long and I felt like I was swimming in it because there was so much material. I called Almy and was questioned about my measurements and confirmed them. I was told they sent out the correct size but I could return it and they would measure it to see that the correct one was sent out. So now I need to rewrap it and send it back then wait to hear back. I ordered it because I was playing 7 Services this summer but now I am borrowing one. I'm very disappointed that the sizing was incorrect. Will update later to see what the final outcome is.

"We had a 3 nights stay in late December 2016. The room was okay, clean enough and the buildings are quite new. At arrival, we were a bit frustrated to learn that the bed and breakfast option we selected (and for which we already paid a considerable sum of money) did not include ANYTHING outside the sleep and breakfast service, i.e. no access to main building, no swimming pool access, no activities, no beach access. All this was not clearly stated in the website at purchase, reason why we complained. By paying an extra 20 Euro/$ per day per person, we got access to all the activities, buildings and buffet for lunch and dinner, but only from 11AM to 11PM. I don't understand the reason for this time limitation, anyway if you book make sure to get straightaway the all inclusive option, otherwise it's definitely not worth the money.

We were at this location by 330 waited for about 15 minutes, before calling hotel to confirm we were in right location, hotel confirmed we were in correct location!!! They said it would just be a few minutes!!! Waited another 15 minutes no shuttle. I called back hotel and they said just a few minutes that shuttle should be there any minute!! By now it's 415 still no shuttle. We had seen numerous other hotel shuttles several times come through but none from embassy suites!! I called back a third time to only be told that in a few minutes shuttle would be there!!! I finally saw first shuttle from embassy suites  after waiting for an hour!!! There service says every 30 minutes. This was the first time I had used this service since I had an early morning flight, not sure if they were having a bad day or what!!!

"3rd revision. I started getting a brake squeal after 1500 miles after the brakes have warmed up. I contacted Brake Performance and I explained that we followed the instructions to the letter. Their response stated that they actually do recommend putting an anti brake seal compound on the pads prior to installation. Well it’s certainly NOT in their detailed instructions. So now if I don’t want squealing brakes I have to take the vehicle back to the shop and pay a second time so they can pull the pads back out to add the anti brake squeal and reinstall. Not happy at this point. I was specific in following those instructions and I purposely told the technician no to the anti squeal when they were originally installed because the instructions SPECIFICALLY said NO chemicals can be put on the rotors or you will void your lifetime warranty. But now it’s ok to use anti brake squeal AFTER I already installed them and now have an issue. Why in the F$&@ would that little piece of important information not be included on n the instructions? I am upset that I have to go back to the dealer and pay a second time when this clearly could have been avoided. Good brakes, they stop well but definitely not a fan of the way this has worked out for me. I hope they update their instructions to include this otherwise others may have the same issue. Wondering how they determine if a brake rotor is eligible for warranty? Does the testing they do tell them what kind of chemicals have been applied? Not really adding up to me. Frustrated!!!!! IRevised review. Ok I have just gone back and changed from a 3 to a 4 star review. I just had the brakes installed and the process was seamless. All the parts were a direct fit and the initial results are very good. The bedding process is a little lengthy but if you follow it exactly as printed you too should have no issues. The brakes are quiet and stop very well. 1st initial review I can’t speak for the brakes themselves as I’ve yet to install. Should be next week. My only issue was that after I placed the order I received a message and was asked to contact them back concerning my order. When I did they only wanted to confirm the billing address and shipping address. This delayed my order by a couple of days and I think it was unnecessary since I confirmed it when I placed the order. I get the whole fraud thing but there should be a simpler process that doesn’t hold up the orders. It is difficult trying to balance where to have it shipped where you know it’s secure and requires a signature instead of dropping at my door when I am not home so some damn porch pirates can take it before I get home and have the pleasure of watching them take it on your cameras. I’ll update after the install as I am excited about the new brakes. Hopefully they are well worth the money spent and the reviews I read were accurate.",1,Brake Performance,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/544a9b4200006400057b1f63/198x149.png,http://www.brakeperformance.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"This is the 4th time I have booked with this company and every time they blow the competition`s pricing away.    This time it was nearly a saving of around $250 to $300 per person for flights to New Zealand.    My only real gripe and it`s a small one compared to the pricing I get is that they take up a lot of time on the phone with you afterwards.   You book online and check all of the details yourself but before the booking is confirmed with the airline they call you and go over all the details over the phone.   This time they wanted me also to fill out a credit card authorization, send a copy of my credit card with numbers blanked out except for final four, copy of driver`s license and passport.     I understood the reason why but then they wanted me to send another authorization because they said my signature wasn`t matching my driver`s license.     For anybody who remembers signing their driver`s license you do this on a signature pad and then they copy it onto the license they send you in the mail and so it can look a little transposed and shrunken.

"I was really starting to enjoy this service more than Beiber bus until my last 2 experiences. The first time we were delayed for hours, granted it was because the driver fell I'll, so understandable. We received an email saying we would receive a $25 coupon for the delay and never got it. I contacted OurBus before booking my next ride regarding the coupon and never received a reply. This second time the bus I was supposed to take changed pick up locations and we were notified via email and text, however they failed to mention that the bus was not actually going to be a bus. Once I got there there was only a small van/bus thing with no label saying the bus company and regular buses from other companies. The OurBus staff did not make any last call announcement as I stood there for maybe 10 mins wondering where the bus was. Once I approached the OurBus staff and asked them were it was, that's when they told me the little bus/van that had already left was my bus. I was told I would have to be standby for the next bus 2.5 hours later, even though I had booked my trip days in advance.

"My daughter received the certificate to get her permit through this program. It fit our budget which was great. I paid extra for her to study the 100 questions for the permit test at the DMV. That seemed to be a waste of money because she failed the DMV test twice in a row.  We took home the booklet from the DMV for her to study.  She liked the free booklet a lot better than the test questions on Idrivesafley.com, and after using it to study she did great on the test and finally passed. When I took her to practice actual driving I didn't realise that none of the mechanics of driving were taught to her in the course. She didn't know what a turn lane was, or simple things that I thought every kid would know, like the fact that you use a blinker to change lanes.  I guess since she always sat in the backseat on her cell phone growing up she hadn't paid attention to basic driving.  She started out trying to use her left foot for the break and the right for the gas. Aye aye aye. She has almost completed her 50 hours of driving, but I'm still not sure that is enough practice, honestly. One time she was making a left turn and looked left, then looked right, waited for the car to pass, then didn't double check again to the left before turning and turned right out in front of a semi. She also got confused while pulling into a parking space, hit the gas and the car lurched onto the sidewalk almost crashing into the window of the store. This was after she had already had twenty hours of practice driving. Her father and I have done all of the instruction. It would have been less nerve wracking to pay someone else, but it saved us hundreds of dollars. I wish the coarse would have included a video similar to Motor Mania and Freewayphobia which is an old Goofy driver's instruction video. Even though it is old it teaches some basic skills I think are still relevant. I found some of the video on youtube I plan to have her and our younger daughter watch it.",1,iDriveSafely,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4d993b5200006400050f6c6a/198x149.png,http://www.idrivesafely.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I recently bought a car from Carvana and while I was very apprehensive through the entire process; buying a car online is scary your first time.  The customer service representatives were amazing and very patient, kind and explained everything in detail no matter how many times I asked the same questions.  Then came the first hiccup in the process, I had my car scheduled for delivery on Saturday afternoon; on Friday afternoon customer care called and said they had to let a delivery driver go and could no longer deliver the car on requested date they did offer to give me a uber code to go and pick up the car.  Luckily my boyfriend was available to driver me to their location to retrieve the car.  I was understanding to this situation being a manager myself and knowing the struggles of turn over rates. At the pick up everything went smooth and everyone was very pleasant and helpful; again great employees. Once i got in my new car i noticed it had not been cleaned at all.  I couldn't see out the front window due to smudgy steaks all over, the floor board was covered in dirt and just normal dirty for used car the outside could have used a car wash as well.  For a dealership one would think you would receive a nice clean car used or not, so this was disappointing to say the least.  All somewhat small things that i just took note of and i didn't let it bother me or turn me off that much due to the wonderful service I received along the way.  The car looked great and was exactly what they said.  So I decided to take it for the 7 day test drive. of course my first plan of action was to take it to my trusted mechanic and have everything looked at to ensure it was a good car. Well seeing as i bought the car on a Saturday night I had to wait until Monday to take it in to get looked at.  Sunday morning I get in my car to run some errands and that's when i hear it.  I clunking rattling sound from the left tire well area.  Knowing a little about cars i figured this was my struts.  So i call carvana and the warranty to see what to do. They suggested getting it to mechanic and see what exactly is going on.  So I took to my mechanic first thing Monday morning.  where they did confirm that my left strut was shot.  Seeing how I still have 5 days left on test drive I tell them to get it fixed with the warranty. It takes until WEDNESDAY to get the approval from warranty to cover the cost of repairs leaving me now with two days left on 7 day test drive.  While it has been a true struggle to fight with warranty everything else has been great.  The car is fixed and no further issues seen.  My mechanic did say it appears that in transferring the vehicle it was dropped on its left side destroying the struts completely on that side.  This goes to back the story from Carvana on letting go a delivery driver I'm assuming the one who dropped my car; however, the fact that after a vehicle was dropped they failed to re-inspect vehicle is quite unprofessional and very upsetting.  If the warranty would not have covered repair 100% I would have returned the car immediately and asked for full refund. However, I spent 5 months looking at cars and deals and I fell in love with the one I picked and couldn't find a better deal at another dealership. So over all the idea is amazing and the employees (that are still there) are with out a doubt wonderful, I do feel there are quite a few things that can be fixed and looked into a little deeper and some policies need to e put in place about how to present a new car to customer, it should be cleaned, detailed and told if anything happened in transit with the offer to repair any issues 100% upfront.  This is the best way to build rapport. At this time I'm keeping my new car; however, I do not feel I will buy from them again unless these things are addressed and fixed.",1,Carvana,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/520b9ccb000064000576666c/0x0.png,http://carvana.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I switched from Apple's print service to Motif this year to print the annual calendars for my family, since Apple discontinued their print service.  Out of six calendars I ordered, one had to be rejected, since the colors were off significantly. I contacted Motif and once they reviewed my case they reprinted and resent the calendar with express mail at no charge.  I appreciate the rapid response, but must say, that with over 70 prior projects ordered through Apple in the past decade, I never had a single reclamation. However, in the end all calendars turned out well - and I appreciated the additional layout options that I did not have before. One comment for the next year - please provide the option of ordering calendars with 13 or 14 months - going into January or February.  Frequently, calendars are created and ordered over the Holidays, and the family members therefore do not receive their calendars before the middle of January.  In prior years everyone appreciated having the calendars last through January so that they could continue to use them to note upcoming appointments, etc.",1,Motif,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5b36332235abc20001d51919/0x0.png,http://motifphotos.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I wanted a different experience on car shopping, and oh boy I got one. I am not at all disappointed in the quick effortless buying experience at all with in a week and a half I had the vehicle in the driveway, definitely a 5 star on quick. Where I had the issue and where I gave 3 stars was the package with temporary plate was supposed to be here before the vehicle, well I asked where it was was told they are going to send me email with temp plate and for me to print it out for time being so I could at least drive the vehicle, nothing about why package was delayed or when it would arrive, I did what they said printed it out and drove Chevy Trax 2 blocks and police had pulled me over. I live in a town of 896 people so that printed out temp plate, the officer was not having it. So 7 day “free” trial I am down to 2 days and got to test out the vehicle for 2 blocks. Called customer support and asked why I have not received the package yet, Lady on other end said it it will take awhile for registration and plates to show up, at this point I am confused because this package was supposed to arrive before the vehicle. So finally I explained to her that I never received temp plates no paperwork no nothing at all, so put me on hold and came back and said how sorry she was and that there is a lot of new employees and that my package will be shipped out right away. Ok so 6 days later, vehicle still sits in driveway and my 7 day test drive is the next day, so I had no 7 day worry free anything because there are “new people” and if I would have not called after police pulled me over I would have still been waiting for temp plates and papers to sign. I have 3 stars because of the mix up and no 7 day nothing...but the quick hassle free car buying was excellent!",1,Carvana,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/520b9ccb000064000576666c/0x0.png,http://carvana.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I bought the New York Pass assuming ot would save me time and money. It did neither for three key reasons. 1 - it didn't get me in lines that were quicker, although the advertising promised that. The New York City Pass, the New York Pass - there are so many passes that promise shorter lines that it's impossible for all the purchasers to have a short line. I waited just as long as everyone else, which was especially frustrating at places like the Statue of Liberty - where I waited for nearly two hours. However in every line I was in, there was a group who sailed past all the rest of us and saved HOURS - those who bought tickets online for a specific time. That's what I'll be doing next time. 2 - it didn't save money. I bought a five day pass, thinks I could get to three attractions per day, which . Wrong. Each attraction alone takes up half a day to do it justice. And by day three I was exhausted from all the walking and subway travel that I ended up doing only two things pwr day. Plus a number of the places I wanted to go (eg most of the museums) have a 'suggested fee', allowing poorer patrons like me to pay what we can afford. The 'savings' in the NY Pass only take into account the top suggested fee - so no saving there for me as I wouldn't have paid the top fee. And finally re saving money - don't believe what it says about savings on Broadway shows. The savings are only $10, they aren't good seats, and if you go to the TKTS booth early, you're likely to get much cheaper and better seats than the ones promised in the NY Pass literature. 3 - I have an issue with the requirement.of using the NY Pass on consecutive days. As discussed, I bought a five day pass. By day three I was tired, by day five I was exhausted. I would be much more likely to buy the pass in the future - and recommend it to others - if you could spread your visits to attractions acrossore days. You need a rest day now and then! In that case, you would be much more able to get your money worth. As it is, I would never recommend buying the NY Pass. Rather - book things like Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty online and arrive at a specific time. Buy Broadway tickets from TKTS in Times Square. The main value I got from the NY Pass was the information on the website, which helped me plany trip. I wouldn't buy it again unless the ruled about consecutive use were changed. Even then, I'd think twice. There are many ways of saving money in NYC and this is not necessarily one of them.",1,New York Pass,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/4f0c80230000640005122f08/0x0.png,http://newyorkpass.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I almost gave a 4 star rating but I feel like there is enough room for improvement. I spent way too much time trying to figure out why the humidity/temp sensor wouldn't work. It gave me issues right out of the box after sync. and after deleting and re-syncing the device, it was no longer discoverable. The product info from one sensor to the next is inconsistent and makes it difficult to compare products. I wasn't able to easily compare and shop for the ideal sensors so I ended up just buying a few of each to spread around the house. The 1080 cam we bought for some reason doesn't go full screen when we flip the phone sideways but the iota cam does. There isn't much in the way of instructional for the hardware unless I'm searching for specific issues through the site. For example, I'm not sure yet what the SD card is being used for that I put directly into the iota. I am holding off on buying another for the 1080 cam until I can figure out how it is being used. It doesn't seem necessary. The thumbnail disappears every 3 days which I believe is a part of pushing people towards paid services. But I'm not sure why I wouldn't be able to tell it to snap another snapshot automatically to update the thumbnail. Or to store a thumbnail on the SD card so it doesn't go away after 3 days. I also had to disable the motion sensor because of my cat but I would have rather a setting that allowed me to switch the sensor to record only instead of just an on and off button. I bought a variety of door/window hardware, acoustic glass break sensors, humidity/temp sensor, I didn't order enough stickers. I am not thrilled with the 1080 cam that I bought, so I am going to try to buy a z-wave cam from another source and see if it syncs up with the abode system. I would also love more information from Abode on how to integrate their system with my echo dot. I downloaded the app but it doesn't seem to be kept up with.",1,abode,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/5b281c43a548f00001b1dce7/0x0.png,http://goabode.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"StubHub's greatest strength is the web traffic they promote.  It helps broaden the number of potential buyers/sellers in the market, making it easier to find tickets most events.  However, the fee structure is completely absurd.  10% (minimum) on the seller and rates fluctuating between 15-30% on the buyer (usually 20%).  On a $10 ticket I guess I wouldn't flinch at that, but it gives me pause on tickets ranging up $100+.  StubHub makes $30 on $100 ticket for acting simply as an intermediary.  They don't even change the scan code on the tickets to help prevent fraud, like TicketMaster does.  The fees for StubHub should be capped.  I looked at Packers tickets recently and the fees were going to be over $100 just on me as a buyer, let alone the seller, for two tickets costing a little over $200/piece.  StubHub stood to easily make $150 in fees on two tickets for doing nothing but having a website.

"The rental of our vehicle went fairly smoothly and the cost was quite reasonable, I guess that's why the outside of the vehicle had some dents and scratches.

"EzCater is a relatively reliable company, with many options for caterers and a user-friendly website. Something that could be improved are the portion sizes listed per caterer. Often times what is listed as ""feeds 25"" actually is enough to feed double that amount. This results in a lot of food waste. However, if the same amount of food is ordered from a different caterer, that ""feeds 25"" could actually be spot on. It would be great if ezCater could somehow inform its customers exactly how much food they are going to get based on pieces, pounds, etc. rather than head count, which is more often than not, inaccurate. In addition to this, we have had a number of occasions where our caterers were late to delivery and rather than being informed from ezCater that our food would be late, we were the ones who had to reach out for help. We understand this is a difficult process to facilitate, considering it requires compliance from both the caterer and the customer, but it would be great if ezCater could provide more real-time updates before problems arise, rather than after the fact.",1,ezCater,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/53d960de0000640005792c4a/198x149.png,http://www.ezcater.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Booked through TripAdvisor and paid through Cancelon.  Received a voucher which was presented to the resort at arrival. The resort had NO reservation for us (??) but they accepted the voucher and nothing was said until we tried to leave the resort, only to be told Cancelon had never paid the resort.  The resort demanded we pay for the entire stay again!  We refused and spent 2 hours arguing with Cancelon and the resort trying to get things resolved. We missed our plane home because the resort detained us like criminals and would not release us unless we repaid the bill. Long story short we had to pay it again and barely made it out of the Dominican Republic. Cancelon was easy to get on the phone, but it literally took hours of having the same conversation over and over to get someone to offer to refund us our money since we had to pay the resort directly.  They did ultimately respond by refunding our money plus $100.  The entire thing was a horrible ordeal, but I do appreciate Cancelon stepping up and getting our money back to us in a timely fashion. Be careful with these type of bookings.  Make sure you verify with the hotel the day before your arrival that they have a reservation for you, and that they've received the payment for the stay.",1,Cancelon,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/589cd7880000ff00059c669f/198x149.png,http://cancelon.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

It is not easy and it looks cheap. After have used my jacket only 4 times, the zipper looks old and messy already. The jacket is nice. Looks very chic but, I used it a couple of times around Lake Tahoe (where I live) and it is not as warm as my boyfriend´s. Also, be aware that it is long.

"I don't think  FDR was honest with me when they said they could reduce all my credit debt through their program.

"This is just a heads up. Website is great, easy to use and book, but there are a couple of things to be aware of. Firstly, if you book and carrentals.com confirm whilst the rental firm is closed - you will not receive a confirmation voucher, even though booking is confirmed and money taken from your card. Secondly, selecting the cheapest options available will result in you getting the oldest cars in that rental companies fleet. I booked with 'getyourcar' in Paphos, which is actually run by Sixt. However, you get what you pay for. Sixt customers get cars not older than 3 years. GetYourCar customers seem to get get ones 5 years and older. I had to switch the first the 2012 Skoda Octavia I got as it would shudder at any speed over 70 kmh, and it was replaced with an even older 2011 version that wasn't much better. It is fine, does the job, and there was no problems with the Sixt team about an exchange - but it is a bit misleading to suggest that the search is on like for like cars. It is NOT.

"My 87 yo Mom moved from Florida to NY- it was a quick move, not much time to take care of important business like insurance. Not having a good handle on the differences between medi-gap, medicare supplement, etc I did follow through with reaching out to this company. The initial experience was good, not really anything that I couldn't have done myself- but it was a time saver re: plan comparison. Willie Tello was helpful in educating me regarding coverage. I would give Mr. Tello a 5. I signed up with the Plan N with him because he had devoted so much time in educating me and comparing the plans. Moving onto pharmacy coverage, that was an issue. One of the medications my Mom uses is a Nitro patch. I was told that this medication was not covered, the cost would be approximately $475/month. It seemed a little steep, especially considering the medication was covered while she was living in Florida- could NY be that different? Something had occurred with ""the computers"" that the young man stated he would ""call you back"" shortly. While waiting, I researched Humana prescription coverage myself. I put all my Mom's meds in (just like they do at SelectQuote). Hmmm.......Nitro patch is a covered item, some restrictions (such as frequency of filling) but definitely presented as covered. The guy called back, I advised him of what I saw online. He was not aware, did not offer to research himself. I said I would call Humana directly, which I did. The gentleman at Humana was so helpful and I ended up signing up for my Mom there. Yesterday the test was done. Prescription for Nitro patch called into the pharmacy (who was helpful in obtaining the ID for us as the sign up is so immediate no time to get the card!!

"Well, it's the 4th day with Jihad's new car from you and guess what?  It's not running.

"The car was totally fine, and that's what's important.  It was waiting for us as per the reservation.  No complaints about that.  I would just like to point out that I think much better info could be provided regarding the pickup and dropoff locations.  In both cases, we spent quite a long time hunting.  For the pickup, we were given the address ""Atocha station"" (Madrid), followed by an address.  Well, I know where Atocha station is, so I didn't look at the rest.  But, this pickup place was about 1/4 mile from the station.  It was a tiny desk in the lobby of a hotel.  There was nothing to tell you it was there.  We dragged our bags all over the place before finding it.  It's true that the rest of the address correctly identified this hotel and its location.  But, the words ""Atocha station"" should not have been included; they were misleading. The return was worse.   We dropped the car in Montpellier, France.  The Hertz booth, as it turns out, is in a parking lot that is about 10 lots removed from the train station (and there are no signs anywhere to tell you where it is).  In this case, there was no street address; just the name of the street.  We literally drove around for 2 hours and could not find that Hertz place, though it was easy to find the right street.  In the end, I called the Hertz people and got better directions.  I think it would be useful if AutoEurope could provide very detailed descriptions as to where these rental offices are, with maps.  (Oh, btw: the info people in the Madrid Atocha station said they had never heard of Hertz.  They said all car rental places were within the station...which was not true....)",1,Auto Europe US,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/47ff62d2000064000502410e/198x149.png,https://www.autoeurope.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I have purchased from RedCoach twice before, my first ticket was a First Class ticket and my second was Business class. Both of my original experiences were wonderful. The busses were pretty much the same besides the seats being smaller on the latter. My third experience was a little different. I had purchased business class again, but this time was completely different. The bus was quite smaller, as well as not being as comfortable, and the ride wasn't smooth at all. I'm not sure if my original two experiences were just mix ups with the bus and I had not truly gotten a business class bus, but this third experience made me not want to purchase business class again. It was very unlike the description that was on the site. Not only that, but the seat I had reserved for myself was taken up by the driver's two bags, which I had to then move myself so I could seat myself and my belongings.

"I purchased tickets for my girlfriend to visit me in America.  She's from Spain, and this was her first time visiting America.  I opted in and paid for extra protection just in case something went wrong during her transit.  While she was at the airport waiting for her first flight back to Spain, she found out at the last minute that her flight had been delayed, which would cause her to miss her connecting flight.  She ended up being stranded at the second airport.  I contacted Sky-Tours and asked if they would provide a hotel for her.  Sky-Tours told me that I would have to pay for a hotel, then send them proof that my girlfriend missed her connecting flight because her first flight had been delayed.  They promised to reimburse me for the cost of the hotel.  I informed my girlfriend about this, and she decided to just stay at the airport for all of those hours. Now as I think about that, it makes no sense.  What's the point of paying for protection ahead of time if I'm going to end up having to pay for the hotel room anyway?  If I have to pay out of pocket for a hotel room in case of an emergency, then there's no point of me paying for any type of protection to begin with.  The purpose of me paying ahead of time is so I won't have to pay in emergency situations.  Since I paid for that protection, then Sky-Tours should have just provided the hotel room with no questions.  It's not like people volunteer to be stranded at an airport. One good thing I can say about Sky-Tours is that they did in fact have the best prices I could find, and the tickets were legitimate.  The ticket-purchasing process was very simple and straightforward.  I would definitely use Sky-Tours again, but I'll never purchase their extra protection again.  That was a total waste of my money.",1,Sky-Tours,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/49303710000064000503edb2/0x0.png,http://www.sky-tours.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"My experience started out great. I was looking at ordering either 50 or 100 USB's for my company with our logo. I had my mind set on a particular style but after my account manager got in touch with me and sent me a sample box, I was intrigued by the ""on the go"" styles that offered a second port you could plug into your mobile devices. My account manager was quick to respond and follow up with quotes and info I requested. I asked whether the port would be compatible with our company phones (iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s - same port) and was told it would be. Here are the exact words of my account manager “Yes, it will definitely fit into an iPhone 6S and other iPhone models with a USB-C port” And then when I asked this again just to be 100% sure before ordering he replied with “Yes, if you choose the USB-C connector, it will fit the iPhone 7” so I placed the order for 100 of these flash drives without hesitation. Keep in mind, these were more expensive than the original style we had planned to order. When I received the USB's I was excited to plug them into my phone and test out how we could share info on our company phones. However, I was very disappointed to quickly realize they do not fit into our phones. Not even close. I immediately contacted my account manager about this issue. I told him how dissapointed I was that I was mislead to believe these were compatible with our company iPhones. This was over a week ago and this issue has still not been resolved. My account manager has been so slow to get back to me with solutions to this issue. Always calling this an ""inconvenience"" and never acknowledging his mistake. He now tells me all the devices this USB IS compatible with which does not make a shred of difference to me since they are useless in our phones which is why we purchased them. I have had to follow up several times when he hasn't got back to me when he says he is going to. Always saying he is waiting on his ""Quality Control Team"" and he appreciates my patience. I have asked for a manager to get back to me on this issue and this request was ignored. At this point I have been offered 30% off on my next order but there will be no next order. I shouldn't be paying full price for a product that does not do what was promised and I shouldn't be waiting over a week for a solution when he was so quick to respond to every email prior to this order being placed. I have asked again in big bold letters for a manager to contact me and that is where this issue now stands... Edited to add a manager did reach out to me and resolved this issue. I was offered a partial refund to compensate for this error which I accepted. I appreciate the quick follow up once I escalated the issue.",1,Flashbay,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/4bdc9828000064000505dc60/198x149.png,http://www.flashbay.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

Overall my experience was decent. There were a few hiccups during the process and had to reach out to customer service via email to try to have two additional items added to my cart. She was not able to change my order and told me to reorder. However I was told I could use a promo code and only to have it not work because it was entered in the first time. The girl didn't seem to understand that I still wanted these items because she kept asking if I wanted to cancel my order or keep it as is. She ended up giving me a different promo code  after I placed a new order and she was able to cancel my previous one which worked out. The order came extremely quick which was great. When I tried the top on it was too large for me but customer service said since I used a promo code the item was unable to be returned or exchanged. I would have liked to exchange it for an extra small for a better fit since I am wearing it for a wedding.

"Fairly easy to use, good way to get rid of a car. A couple of hang-ups: the check required getting an authorization code by going on line or calling a toll free number. It was very difficult to find how to get the code online, and when I called the toll free number, it didn't seem to accept the numbers I put into the automated menu. I also filled out a contact form online to get the code and never got a response. The other hang-up was that the bid I originally received changed several times and was also cancelled once.

When I opened the package, one of the bottles had leaked into the package. Not much was lost so I wasnt upset about it. I sent customer service an email and recommended that they add another layer of bubble wrap to the packages. I didn't request a replacement or refund. I got an email 2 days later simply stating ""we'll look into it"". That was 9 days ago. Yet, I get spammed constantly to review my purchase. So here it is. I'll probably still order juice here.

What concerns me is that the second order also listed a 4 lb bag order but when it came it was  2 lbs, which is fine because the 2 orders equals the 4 lbs I wanted, But what is concerning is does this company even have 4lb bags in stock. Do customers need to order a quantity of 2 when placing an order? The order page lists 4 lb bags but I am beginning to believe they are not available.

"First time renting from enterprise not feeling completely satisfied. Had a double upgrade promotion using Visa card. Arrived on time at rental place and looks like they're slightly behind 5 renters and bending over backwards trying to find the right car for a customer ahead of me. I check in (with new guy Matt) and tell them about the double upgrade. 15-20 mins later they have my car ready.. Except no double upgrade or even single upgrade. They didnt even attempt or offer to check other locations. The guy (Bradley stepping in to help new guy Matt) really pushed to get me in the economy car and instead of asking for a ride home and picking me back up when a double upgrade car is available I just took the economy car. This is probably due to them being behind. The consolation offer was 2 bars of gas and a future double upgrade. Thinking back this is unacceptable because my visa card always has double upgrade. Again even though I arrived on time they were slightly behind maybe 5 people and when they saw me looking like a non professional who wouldn't complain they could get me out with the eco car.

That creates it's own problem to first pull the number from my address list and then enter mostly a 12 digit # manually. All this can never be done on the go but only e.g. in a stopped vehicle because it is a 2 handed operation with a good chance of a typo. Please allow your App to use pause symbols or dial slower.

"My sons and I each got a 3-day pass. We liked the pass and found it helpful. But... it seemed a lot of money to pay for only three days and there were far too many things to do in just 3 days. The time estimates were unrealistic and some of the suggested ""what to do in a day"" were absolutely impossible to accomplish. We barely got through half what we had planned. So the value in the 3-day pass was not really there for us. In the end we did some things that we probably wouldn't have done if we were paying individually... and all those things were marginally entertaining for us. The 'front of the line' didn't really apply except at Empire State Building where there was no lineup anyway.We didn't have time to get to the harbour & Statue of LIberty, which was a real shame. Maybe next time! We have used city passes in a number of places (LA, San Diego, Orlando, Seattle) and have always been happy with them. I would suggest that you consider lowering the cost of the 3-day pass and allowing individuals to bundle 10 activities for that lower cost. That way a 3-day pass might feel more do-able and cost -effective. Another suggestion  is to allow a 3-day pass to be used on 3 out of five days instead of consecutively. We were exhausted by the end of our 3 days and still didn't get to everything we wanted to see. I get that NY is huge and has many things to do, but I resented paying the higher price for ALL the stuff when you could, realistically, only take advantage of 3 things per day.",1,New York Pass,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/4f0c80230000640005122f08/0x0.png,http://newyorkpass.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I reviewed the site as well as the product.  I just placed my order and hope I wont be disappointed. Update.  12-20-16 Honestly this process has been very frustrating.  I ordered on the 9th of Dec. and I am still waiting for a tracking number.  I have called and emailed several times.  I have spoken with 2 or 3 different people and there is always some ""reason"" I don't have one yet. I was supposed to get one yesterday and didn't.  I called this morning and they said they had it and emailed it to me.  I got the number and entered it into the shippers system and it was not found.  I called the shipper and they tried looking by tracking number, name, phone, address - nothing. I call Joesav  back and they looked it up again and said ""oh yeah I see the problem.  I have to send the shipper and email.  Give me 5 minutes.""  I asked how long it would take the shipper to update and they said ""give them an hour""  Five hours later still nothing.  I called Joes back again and tried to explain this and was immediately transferred to voicemail.  So I still don't know if I am getting my wife's new TV before Christmas. Their price is great and I believe the only reason people buy from them is price.  These people are rude.  They have zero personality for customer service.  If I had to do this over again I wouldn't.  I had better get a valid tracking number tomorrow or I am going to cancel this order because I have no evidence to show me this has been shipped. Got a valid tracking number last night.  The shippers website stated ETA to be Jan. 4, 2017 (but possibly before).  So much for the 7 to 10 day window I paid for.  When I bought the TV I was told that the free shipping was up to 21 days.  However if I bought the Mack extended warranty they would upgrade my shipping to the expedited 7-10 day.  Definitely a lie to get me to buy the extended warranty.  Now waiting for TV to show up. Jan. 11th 2017 The TV showed up the day after Christmas.  I was wanting the day before but so be it.  My problem now is 2 fold.  I am still waiting for the Mack warranty I purchased.  I was told a couple of times they would email it to me.  Has not happened yet.  Second I am waiting on the $150 refund for the amount I was overcharged.  That is a long story but the point is I still don't have the money refunded yet.  These people are a pain in the butt to deal with.",1,Joe's AV,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/559594280000ff000580a7f4/198x149.png,http://joesav.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Bought a 3 day New York pass in August 2013. It was good a friend had a book we could look at prior to arriving in New York so we could get the most out of the attractions. Would have been good if attractions had been grouped together so you could see more in a smaller area. ie: rockafeller centre tour, tour NBC in the same building, and top of the Rock. Utilised the phone app and found this helpful especially the map, an idea may be to integrate notifications on attractions available nearby based on GPS location. Hop on/hop off bus found not useful between attractions. Would have been quicker to use subway. Bike hire for Central Park should be stipulated that they cannot be ridden on paths. This then does not allow you ride too attractions. Have to ride a long ways round, can't cut through the park. This should be told in the book.

In other words, it will expire before I can use it all feeding my cats. I called PetFlow and they offered to let me return the recently received product and they would send another bag, BUT, they CANNOT guarantee it will have a better date range - thus that's a rather worthless option as I might just receive another bag with the same exp date.  Obviously this means the product has been sitting in their warehouse, or stock is not properly rotated. I would rather buy from small local pet supply stores, but when that is not an option I choose Chewy as the prices are almost identical across all online retailers.",1,PetFlow,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/4ecc25e00000640005119cbc/198x149.png,http://petflow.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I used this site for the first time book my flight. I found the best prices here but started freaking out after reading these reviews. First, I did pay the extra fee for cancellation within 24 hrs. Not sure why I decided to pay this but I could have saved another $75 if I didn't. I guess I thought it would give me an extra 24 hrs to search a better flight. I think 3 days would maybe it would have been worth it. I read all of the information on baggage fees so I was not surprised about that fee. The day before my flight, I get an email from JustFly saying ""last chance to reserve seats"" which alarmed me because at first I thought I did not save my reservation. I went to the site and there were only 8 or 9 seats left and only one row where the seats were together! So I proceed to reserve the last few seats together and see there is a charge of about $12 per seat!! So almost another $50 bucks. No thanks. I will take my chance at the check in (which you do right from the Alaska site). I can't tell if Alaska charges that fee but I was surprised that the only seats left were at the back of the plane even though I checked in exactly 24 hrs in advance. I get to the ck in and I am able to reserve the seats for free...whew! Not sure if it is less stressful to do it direct. I might use justfly again. we'll see. I guess if you don't have to cancel or make changes to your flight, this option works well and saves you money.",1,JustFly,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/54dfeb180000ff00057d6ca6/198x149.png,http://justfly.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"This is my honest experience - some of your food is absolutely delicious when plated with vegetables; however, I have found your boxed dry food is among the worst I've ever had.  Someone there should taste it after it has been boxed and sat around for awhile.  Most of my experience with your boxed food has been awful.  The frozen food is quite good and I order as much of it as I can.  I've been on this diet for approximately 2 months and have only lost 5 pounds.  It does leave me hungry at times or at the least not satisfied.  Breakfast items (frozen) are fairly good.  Hamburgers, chicken sandwiches good.

I booked the installation to place my 65in TV on a cabinet not the wall. The office book me for service between 1-3pm on Tuesday the 25th. About 3:15 that afternoon the office called and said that they had to cancel the appointment because of some personal issues with the installer. Then about 5min later the installer called me and said that he could come if it was alright with me. The installer arrived (alone) at 4pm and (I) had to help him remove the TV from the box and place it on the table so the stand could be installed on to the TV. The installer didn't have tools so I provided him with the tools needed. He completed the stand and then (we) moved the TV to the cabinet. (I) helped him hold the light to attach the components. (I) helped him work through the controllers to complete the set up. Without my help there was no way he could manage the TV by himself!,1,SERVIZ Inc,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/53c83d7a0000640005791ae5/198x149.png,https://www.serviz.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

Certainly not something I would've been happy paying over 60 for if I didn't have the groupon.  Some of my flowers didnt make it 3 days even so I contacted them and they responded right away with an offer for a new bouquet or a credit. I took the credit since I didnt want 2 sets of the same type to die but I only got credit for the original, not the deluxe I ordered since I used a groupon (which I didnt know )So now I have a credit that wont even cover a bouquet and delivery from a place with pretty unimpressive flowers.

"I booked a hotel with free cancellation which I cancelled the following day. It's taken one and a half month (almost two weeks more than the 21 working days they say on the website) and a bit of insisting (calls, emails and ultimately a review here) to finally get a call from customer service who then indeed very quickly took care of it. It's only a bit disappointing that companies in general don't seem to care so much and stall you until a review is posted online, rather than solving the issue without any hassle from the beginning. In the end however, it was all sorted at least and other than that one issue, Gala Hotels worked just fine with the reservations I did keep.

"I have printed two series of my fiction through Lulu over the course of the last few years, for personal use and gifts to friends & family only. At first I was impressed by the quality and consistency of the printing. However, with the latest two books in the series, and the few orders I've had to make recently for new copies of the older books, I find that the paper is noticeably thinner, and that the paperback binding is less consistent - many of my last batch of 500 page paperbacks came with crookedly trimmed edges, and severely skewed spines. I'll still use them, since I don't sell these books, but it's disappointing to see the decline in quality.",1,Lulu Publishing,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/46dfb40b00006400050136ad/0x0.png,https://www.lulu.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I live this website has easy payment options and you can pretty much find anything. But the shipping costs are absurd. They stop me from ordering unless there is free shipping. I wanted to order a 30 dollar grill cover but the shipping cost was almost 30 dollars! It's a grill cover. How on earth does it cost 30 dollars to ship it. And then if you go in overstocks a butcher block and 2 orders or kitchen towels cost 4.99 to ship without the free shipping code.  Makes absolutely no sense. You need you reduce shipping rates to make this sight more affordable.,1,Gettington.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4e73fdcf0000640005110547/198x149.png,http://www.gettington.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"Stars: 3.5 I really like the layout of the website. The detailed explanations from the answers to the questions help out a lot!!! Most of the questions & answers have become very very easy. Some of the questions I struggled answering are vehicle mechanical issues (e.g., tire blows, engine fails, car skids) but these answers to the questions are in the Texas Driver's Handbook. Since it floods here in Texas, so far, I have not found questions about ""Flooding."" In the Texas Driver's Handbook, it's on page 53. Also, I've always wondered what the ""Barrels"" were used for. I didn't know that ""barrels that are engineered to act as an impact cushion reduce the seriousness of crashes"" (Texas Driver's Handbook, page 38). I had to search for pictures to see what a car would look like when crashed into those barrels on the highway. The road signs have become redundant. I didn't see road sign questions ""Mounted in front of an obstruction which is close to the edge of the road, such as culverts, or center piers on divided highways"" It's colored grey with yellow lights (or perhaps reflectors?) (Texas Driver's Handbook, page 31). Overall: I wish there were more pictures in the questions. So far, the detailed explanations help clear what's not mentioned in the Texas Driver's Handbook which is the 2017 version & not 2019. The Texas Driver's License Office said they are using the 2017 version & have not updated to 2019 yet.",1,Driving-Tests.org,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/592c32f00000ff0005a36e04/0x0.png,https://driving-tests.org?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"The homeowner was great to work with through the booking and contract process.  I looked at many properties and contacted four or five. After I booked the property I still received booking requests from the other properties. That became very confusing.  It would be great if there was a flag that would stop other inquiries after booking.  I realize that's pretty sophisticated logic, but it would be very helpful. Also, the house I booked is owned by someone from England.  I am being charged a fee by my credit card company for converting from English pounds to US dollars.  This will add an unexpected @$30.00 to the booking.  The fact that there may be currency conversion fees for a foreign owner should be stipulated up front by somebody.

"Overall our experience with vacation express was very good.  The price and flights were much better than I was able to get through other sites.  We did experience a problem with airline seating.  I'm not sure if it was the fault of the airline or the fault of Vacation Express but the flight time changed by 5 minutes and that somehow caused us to lose our seats.  It took a lot of frustration and phone time but we did get seats although not together.  Then, on the way back we were informed the day of our flight that my husband no longer had a seat.  Something about a name discrepancy.  I checked the vacation express documents and his name was spelled correctly on my confirmation, so apparently something happened in the interaction between VA and American Air.  Again...added stress and we were unable to sit together.  Despite these issues, I will most likely use vacation express again.",2,Vacation Express,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/560428690000ff000583acbc/0x0.png,https://www.vacationexpress.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

FareDepot offered the best price for my chosen itinerary. The tickets were marketed by TAM Aerolinhas and TAM allowed me to do seat selections (free of charge) on their flight segment from GRU to EZE. The other flight segments on American Airlines and LAN would not be so gracious. I still hold hope that I can do it on LAN at 48 hours prior to departure from EZE via LIM to LAX. It doesn't look as good on American with their flight from LAX to GRU :-(,2,FareDepot.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/54e2cbf40000ff00057d77bc/0x0.png,http://faredepot.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

EMeals has helped me save time meal planning and has saved me money while shopping. I prefer to do my own shopping rather than use the available shopping services but the app prepares a shopping list based off the recipes that choose and I can also customize the shopping list with additional items I may need. The recipes are delicious and easy to prepare. I had gotten into a rut preparing the same dishes over and over again and EMeals has got me back to cooking new recipes that I love. Edited to add: My only disappointment is that not every recipe includes a picture. We eat with our eyes first and the lack of pictures for a lot of recipes is very disappointing.,2,eMeals,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/4f71eea5000064000513f70a/0x0.png,http://www.emeals.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I absolutely loved working with Quicken Loans. They did call A LOT in the beginning even when we didn't have an update (new home build) so that was a little annoying but once we got closer to closing, the phone calls were necessary and really helpful to make sure we were on track. They also need to do a better job communicating on closing details. We were really unsure what the process was for closing and they were not able to give official details (amount, etc.) until the day before. We have an online only bank so we had to scramble to get a cashier's check before closing. Other than that, I love that everything can be done online. They are really good about getting all the paper work in to make sure everything is good a few weeks before closing so you can relax.

"Unfortunately, you are not identifying which problem I had with Thriftbooks.com and which customer service representative I worked with. Without that information, your survey is meaningless. Please use identifiers specific to the purchase in the future so customers can respond to a particular transaction. These vague inquiries on your part don't help me and, consequently, they will not help you get the feedback you desire. That said, I will respond as if this about the replacement copy I received of the Harry Potter Hogwarts Cinematic Yearbook: Imagine, Draw, Create. The first one I received from Thrìftbooks.com was awful! It had already been written in and scribbled on throughout. Definitely unusable. I wrote to Thriftbooks and received a very fair answer saying that they would replace the copy. I just received the replacement copy and it is in very good condition and I am pleased. I do not have access to the customer rep's name right now, but you can trace it down. So, for this go-round and this transaction only, I give Thriftbooks high marks. However, I find that I am increasingly having to write to Thriftbooks about really awful books they are sending me. Their books are not matching their posted descriptions and their quality control seems to be waning. I have recently received some books from them that were labelled as ""good"" or ""very good"" that were in downright rotten condition. This means Inhave to write to Thriftbooks over and over about replacenent or reimbursement. The books being sent out from their distribution centers are clearly NOT BEING CHECKED FORVFLAWS AND DAMAGE! Shame on them for not doing their due diligence. Please not that I will not be able to continue to provide helpful feedback to you unless you indicate which book(s) or order(s) you are referring to when asking for my help.

"I contacted 10 dealers for the same new car. The TrueCar prices were a good guide, but several dealers played a shell game that muddied the water. A few dealers reduced the advertised price by $3000 and after I arrived told me they added $3000 of products I had to pay for, (pin-stripping, nitrogen filled tires, life time car washes, lifetime oil changes, and more). These dealer additions all had some value, but never the value they claimed. So the TrueCar price is not 100% accurate as a few dealers try and game the system. I had no trade and brought my own financing. That really simplified picking the best dealer with the lowest price.",2,Truecar,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4f59ac410000640005137f49/198x149.png,http://truecar.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"As the sales and marketing coordinator for a company, the biggest and most obvious responsibility is to promote and sell products/services and what better way to promote a quality product with another quality product? Whether it be a trade show or a sales trip, I am confident when I give a potential customer a Flashbay thumb drive. Ever since we began using Flashbay in 2013 we have had no complaints or issues with their products. An additional perk with these is our printing costs have actually decreased because let’s face it,  how many brochures do you see on the ground of the exhibit hall after booth tear down at a trade show and how many more catalogs are probably left in hotel rooms?  Would you rather pack a stack of heavy print materials in your carry on or a lightweight flash drive with the same information? Even if the recipient erases your files to use the flashdrive for personal use, your materials have been seen and your company name/contact info is still seen sticking out of their USB port which is only a few mouse clicks away from your website. If you want great customer service, a reliable and impressive product, Flashbay will accommodate your needs in a ""Flash.""",2,Flashbay,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshotlogo-domain/4bdc9828000064000505dc60/198x149.png,http://www.flashbay.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
"After PCC discontinued my favorite moisturizer and sun screen, I needed to find something I could trust.    Kari Gran is definitely positioned for women, but I found I liked the texture of their sunscreen and use it almost daily.     I bought the rose and lavender moisturizers and thought I would give them away as gifts, but I neglected to read all the details and missed ordering the emulsion.    So I didn't give them away but used the lavender for an aftershave without the emulsion.    I now have the emulsion to add to the lavender moisturizer and I pleasantly use it as an aftershave.     I finally gave the rose moisturizer and emulsion to my friend and she likes it.     When I opened the first parcel, I was charmed with the presentation.        I had snacks with three women friends last evening and they were enthused to look up Kari Gran after my recommendations.",2,Kari Gran,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/54f078980000ff00057db649/0x0.png,https://karigran.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

I initiated contact with SelectQuote by chance selecting an independent insurance broker through the internet.  To my very pleasant surprise my call was answered by Michael Chapman (Mike).  He responded to all my questions extremely well and explained various aspects of Medicare that I was not familiar.  Mike was very efficient and professional throughout the entire interview and application process.  He was very patient and took all the necessary time to make sure that I understood all points discussed.  I just purchased Plan G through Mutual of Omaha with Mike's help and so far so good.  Still pending to receive documents (hard copies) from the insurance company and hopefully that will continue to be a positive experience.  Mike sent me a number of emails as he remained on the phone to make sure that I was able to navigate through the electronic signature process and he made sure that I got the documents via electronic email with attachments.  I have nothing but good things to say about my experience yesterday (Thursday 12/7/2017) with Mr. Chapman.  I would not hesitate to recommend his services to any of my friends and associates.

Their service plans were all over $250, for only three years. From the time I ordered, to the time I actually got the refrigerator, did take a little while. I was in no hurry, so time was not an issue. Plessers kept me informed on the progress of my delivery. The delivery men arrived at the stated time, took the refrigerator off the truck, placed it in my garage, and unwrapped it for inspection.

They were eventually expanded on through out the course, however I would have preferred to learn everything there was to know and have some review later on in the course. One side note, at the end of the course, Ace gets super professional all of the sudden saying “it’s been an honor teaching you” and what not. After all the jokes and references, I would have liked for Ace to be a little more emotional when saying goodbye (even though he’s a robot).",2,Aceable,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/58d54a920000ff00059f227c/0x0.png,https://www.aceable.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"The drivers side window regulator failed on our 1996 VW Cabrio.  A lot of folks said to take it to the dealer because it was a part that fails a lot.  They said the dealer knows better how to repair it.  I looked on the internet  to price the part, anywhere form $40 to $200.  I saw that parts geek had the part for $83.48 plus shipping for a total of $93.43.  Some of the other internet sites  were shipping from China.  Not for me.  I ordered the Window Regulator on Jan 05, 2018 from parts geek  and after getting over the Flu, installed it today.

"I tried this service after seeing it on TV (Shipping Wars).  I had a large odd sized item to ship that needed special care, so i put it out there. Within a few days, I had bids and narrowed it down to one vendor.  Everything worked out fine, no issues. The service gives you plenty of email updates and makes things pretty clear. The one improvement i would like to see is the ability to add photos of the item you're shipping, there seems to be a place for it but for some kind of reasons it's not enabled yet.

"I rent out of the Hopkinsville Ky office. I have nothing but great things to say about Kayleigh Wilson. She was so helpful when I needed to rent a truck. I asked if there was any way possible to get me a Ford F150 so that my tonneau cover would fit. I had some very expensive camera equipment to haul and couldn't get it wet. When I arrived at the Hopkinsville office, she greeted me with a smile and said she had a Ford F-150 for me. Wow, how is that for customer service!

"The gentleman who took my order is a true professional. The problem with my order is that the last two numbers on my address were transposed on the label on my Onkyo receiver, which caused it to be delivered to a neighbor who lives three houses north of me. She got my phone number and we arranged for me to pick it up from her. Since I don't know who prints up the labels, I don't know who to blame for this. However, I now have my receiver. It's installed and works beautifully. The label on the headphones was correct. They work as advertised. Given that you stock things that are not available locally, I recommend Crutchfield.

"Even after looking through the gallery, I was still skeptical since ALL the paintings looked too amazing to be true. I decided to try it out and gave a painting as a birthday gift. They far exceeded my expectations. In fact, I had to really look closely to make sure it was indeed a painting, not a picture! The ordering process was a breeze. The artist responded very promptly even on a weekend. The painting was finished before scheduled time. Although I did not see the finished product because it was sent long distance as a gift, the receiver absolutely loved it. This is a creative idea as a gift to someone special or someone who already has everything. It was not as expensive as I thought it would be.

"I find SHAREMONEY to be a quick & efficient way to send money. SHAREMONEY is thorough & dependable. They provide timely & excellent communication,  throughout the process! My overall experience,  in sending money, via SHAREMONEY was EXCELLENT! The ONLY difficult part was entering the name of the payee; because,  after entering the first name, there is a field for a nickname. My payee Does not have a nickname; so,  when I keyed in NONE; or N/A it kicked me back to the beginning of the process,  until I entered the 1st name, ALSO, as the nickname. The other problem is that Filipino people carry the Maternal name, as their middle name; so, the same name has to be entered a 2nd time; &, therefore, appears twice on the payee's information,  required to pick up the funds. If not for these issues, I would rate SHAREMONEY,  as an OUTSTANDING service provider,  with VERY REASONABLE transfer fees! I have to believe that SHAREMONEY is an INDUSTRY LEADER!

"Hi, I’m a grad mental health counseling student at Nova Southeastern University. I found bookrenter.com while searching only for affordable books for this semester. My budget was extremely strict and also I had very little time to finally get my books. My courses are online so as soon as the semester starts so does my load of work and assignments. None of the other websites had the books that I needed for the price that I could afford. I found the 5 books I was looking for; I rented them for 90 days , paid the $25 express shipping and it all added up to $177 including tax …I was extremely happy and pleased but a little concern about the delivery as I had a couple of bad experiences in the past with other sites. Well, I received my books via FedEx right by the day and time the said I would. I paid for them on a Tuesday night and by that Friday morning they were at my door…I was impressed with the expedite service and the great customer service they provided me with. Since then, I have recommended the site to all of my peers. Saving so much money made a difference for me and I’m really thankful for that. Although I only have one more semester to go before I graduate, I will definitely be getting my books from bookrenter.com again. I wish I knew about Bookrenter.com sooner… Thanks so much for an awesome experience!

They planned a 10-day trip to Madrid, Seville, Granada, and Barcelona just as we requested. They also included Toledo and Ronda as day trips. The specific travel agent we worked with designed a wonderful itinerary which was first built on our request and we used many of her suggestions. She offered a number of options in each city we visited for things to do and hotels. Ultimately, it was always our choice and our travel agent was never pushy. When we arrived in Spain, we found our printed detailed itinerary, which was already provided weeks earlier, at the hotel front desk. In addition the travel agency provided us a loaner cell phone with our travel agents mobile phone number programmed into the phone and an envelope/bag to return the phone that we gave to the front desk at our last hotel. Everything on the trip went as planned except for one transfer which was late and when I contacted our travel agent by phone about it, she took care of it in a few minutes. The travel agency we used through Zicasso was always friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable from before we booked the trip to after our trip ended. I only have positive things to say about them. I would recommend working with Zicasso to anyone coming from the US who want to work with any awesome travel agency in planning a trip to Spain.",2,Zicasso,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/54e658910000ff00057d8a2c/0x0.png,https://www.zicasso.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"OK, so the interest on a quick 14 day couple-of-hundred buck loan is *way* higher than if I had a credit card. But LendUp is completely up-front about the charges. Nothing hidden. The web interface is great. I click on a slider for how much I want, how many days I want it for, and it tells me the interest charge. The money is automatically deposited in my bank account, and in a few weeks, the exact amount specified is automatically withdrawn. Its professional, there are no surprises, and its a really excellent deal to get thru the occasional emergency. I needed car repair. I knew exactly when and where my next paycheck comes. I could afford it--but not until the following Friday! A couple of clicks on LendUp and I've got the money NOW and in a day I have my car fixed. Well worth it. Sure, it would be better if I had savings and credit cards. But I don't. What I do have is a steady job and a predictable income. It's tough living on the ""edge"". But LendUp provides a simple, professional, and easy way to tide me over the cracks, so to speak.",2,LendUp,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/50f45840000064000520c920/198x149.png,https://www.lendup.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

My daughter picked this dress for a dance and really loves it.  Looks very nice on.  Be sure to check the measurements on this one.  She usually wears a size 3/4 but ordered a 5/6 and it was too tight in the chest area and she is only a B.  Customer service was great and helped us exchange it.  She ended up needing a 9/10 in this one.,2,PromGirl,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4bdf5a0f000064000507170b/198x149.png,http://www.promgirl.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"When I started blogging in 2008 I hadn't yet heard of WordPress so began on another blogging site. In Fall of 2009 an author told me about her blog on WP, so I checked it out. I have been blogging on WordPress since January 2010 and hardly even visit my other blog anymore. WordPress is where I prefer to be. It is easy to operate, and when I do have the occasional problem I can't figure out from their help pages I simply ask someone on the WP team. The next day I have my answer. WP uses Akismet to block spam and has a high rate of success. I have so many great themes from which to choose for my blog, and it's easy to set up. My only complaint is that I would like to have affiliate ads on my blog but it is not permitted. Even with that drawback, I Love WordPress; it is my friendly and reliable blogging home.",2,WordPress.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/524568f9000064000576d585/0x0.png,https://wordpress.com/?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

The card that was sent with the package read something very touching. There are some beautiful and sincerely caring people in this world.

The trip was all that we could have asked for and more. We were especially grateful for an excellant tour guide and will definitely request the same on a future trip. So very,very grateful that we could do this!",2,Pilgrim Tours,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/55b7cc260000ff0005818652/0x0.png,https://pilgrimtours.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"Hotels went from satisfactory to very nice as the trip progressed. Bring a hot spot if you need good internet connectivity. Their motor coach WiFi was very hit and miss. Plus without any warning you may get bumped off the WiFi due to “bandwidth limit”. I hope you like chicken or fish. That seems to be the dinner menu choices more often than not. There is a toilet on the bus but they really don’t want you to use it. Bus stops every 2-1/2 hours at the “Auto Grill”. This is a very nice rest stop. Good food. Our tour guide/trip manager was a historian. He had more to share than my brain could absorb. There were other guides of specific monuments and they were awesome too. Our tour was 14 days, which we extended to 16 in London.

"We have used rush order tees for a few orders. Overall a fairly good service. Pro: They are generally flexible about making order adjustments. The orders arrive on-time and without error.

We asked to get t-shirts dyed a specific color, and customer service thought we meant the text being a specific color (they cannot custom dye shirts).

Final product matched the selling picture. Hyvä tuote, laadukas. Saumat kunnossa ja laukun hihnat vankat👍 Laukun sisällä oli musta suojakangas jota en oottanu ollenkaan!

"I wasn't sure how to get audio at my last auction or if it was available but it would have added to the experience. If that is the choice of the auctioneer it might be recommended. Otherwise, the advance notification of my preferences (alerts) has led me to several successful auctions. My work and travel schedule would otherwise make following  auctions let alone discovering items of interest in diverse and international auction houses impossible. With Invaluable the hunt follows me, I log on, register, wait for Invaluable to notify me and bid with confidence, wherever I am and whatever the time. I also appreciate the articles on collections and collecting.

"Kabbage is awesome! The process from application to completion of the business loan was simple, concise and swift. I contemplated applying for the loan, since I'm currently building my business credit but the quiet voice within me kept nudging and saying, ""Trust the process."" I first learned of Kabbage through nav.org. Nav recommended Kabbage as a resource for building business credit. My approval rate was extremely high but the feelings of being denied stung like a bee. However, Kabbage kept popping up....in my email, on social media, in my head......so I decided to LEAP! In less than 5 minutes, I was approved and within 48 hours the funds were deposited into my account. I even received an immediate call from customer service within seconds of submitting the app. The rep was polite, knowledgeable, understanding and hassle free. The funds are already being put to good use and will aid in putting more available inventory on my ecommerce store. Thank you Kabbage! This loan was right on time! I highly recommend their services to entrepreneurs and small businesses who have been denied by big banks and lenders. Kabbage sees and values ""us."" What a blessing!!!",2,Kabbage,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/4fc853c6000064000515f0f6/198x149.png,http://www.kabbage.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click

"I have ordered and used several ink cartridges from Inkfarm.  I have been very satisfied with the results.  Except for the last batch I received, which was 6 black cartridges for my Epson printer.  The first two worked very well, as I have come to expect.  The third could not be accepted by my printer.  I tried the recommended steps to allow it to work, then called Inkfarm.  Inkfarm suggested I try unplugging the printer and leaving it unplugged for fifteen minutes, then try the cartridge again.  That also did not work, so I called Inkfarm again.  In the meantime, I had plugged in cartridge number 4 and was running a rather long ink job, which, at a glance, appeared to be OK, but when I took a closer look I discovered that the printing was very unsatisfactory, so I reported that to the rep I was talking to, a very nice lady.  She said she would send me two re- placements, which I have not yet received.  In the meantime, I have inserted the fifth of the six cartridges, and thought it was working fine.  This was also a long printing job, and after reading the printed results I discovered there were defects in the results.  I have not asked for a replacement for this cartridge because this job was informal, and I could read the results OK, but it won't be satisfactory for a business letter, for example.",2,Inkfarm.com,//s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/screenshots/481734dc00006400050260ea/198x149.png,http://www.inkfarm.com?utm_medium=company_profile&utm_source=trustpilot&utm_campaign=logo_click
